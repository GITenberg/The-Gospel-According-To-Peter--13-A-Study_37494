        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Egypt, in our
        days, ceasing to be any more the land of bondage, has, in more senses
        than one, become a veritable Land of Promise. It is a rich mine of
        historical and literary wealth, alas! most inadequately worked, and
        in that fine climate, with its clear dry air, the footprints of Time,
        leaving scarcely a trace, the treasures of an ancient civilisation,
        even of the most delicate texture, have been preserved to us with
        wonderful perfection. The habits of the peoples that have occupied
        the land have happily combined with the natural advantages of the
        climate, in transmitting to the modern world an inheritance of which
        we are now beginning to take possession. The dead have long been
        giving up their secrets, but it is only in recent times that we have
        been able to realise the fact that the tombs of Egypt may contain
        many a precious work, now known to us but in name, and many a writing
        which may change the current of controversy, and strangely modify
        many a cherished opinion. Without referring here to earlier
        discoveries in support of these remarks, we may at once pass to the
        more recent, with which we have particularly to do.</p><span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page002">[pg 002]</span><a name="Pg002" id="Pg002"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the course of
        explorations carried on during the winter of 1886-87 by the order of
        M. Grébaut, then Director of the Museums of Egypt, two Greek
        manuscripts were discovered in the necropolis of Akhmîm, the ancient
        Panopolis, in Upper Egypt. The first of these was a papyrus, which
        was really found by some Fellahs who quarrelled regarding the
        partition of their precious booty and thus allowed the secret to leak
        out. It came to the knowledge of the Moudir, or Governor of the
        Province, who promptly settled the dispute by confiscating the
        papyrus, which he forwarded to the Museum of Gizeh at Boulaq. This
        MS. is a collection of problems in arithmetic and geometry, carefully
        written out, probably by a student, and buried with him as his
        highest and most valued achievement.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The second
        manuscript was of much higher interest. It was discovered in the tomb
        of a <span class="tei tei-q">“monk.”</span> It consists of
        thirty-three pages in parchment, measuring 6 inches in height by 4-½
        inches in breadth, without numbering, bound together in pasteboard
        covered with leather, which has become black with time. There is no
        date, nor any other indication of the approximate age of the MS. than
        that which is furnished by the characteristics of the writing and the
        part of the cemetery in which it was discovered. These lead to the
        almost certain conclusion, according to M. Bouriant, who first
        transcribed the text, that the MS. cannot be anterior to the eighth
        century or posterior to the twelfth. The ancient cemetery of Akhmîm
        stretches along to the north and west of the hill on which have been
        discovered tombs of the eighteenth to the twentieth dynasties, and it
        has served as a burial-place for the Christian inhabitants of the
        neighbourhood from the fifth to the fifteenth centuries, the more
        ancient part lying at the foot of the hill and extending gradually
        upward for about <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page003">[pg
        003]</span><a name="Pg003" id="Pg003" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> 700
        metres. The tomb in which the MS. was found is in a position which
        approximately tallies, as regards age, with the date indicated by the
        MS. itself.<a id="noteref_1" name="noteref_1" href=
        "#note_1"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1</span></span></a> Of
        course, these indications refer solely to the date of the MS. itself,
        and not to the age of the actual works transcribed in its pages.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The thirty-three
        sheets of parchment, forming sixty-six pages, commence with an
        otherwise blank page, bearing a rough drawing of a Coptic cross, upon
        the arms of which rise smaller crosses of the same description, and
        the letters [symbol] and [symbol] stand the one on the left, the
        other on the right of the lower stem of the large cross. Over the
        page commences a fragment of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Gospel of
        Peter,”</span> which continues to the end of page 10, where it
        abruptly terminates in the middle of a sentence. Pages 11 and 12 have
        been left blank. Pages 13 to 19 contain a fragment of the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Apocalypse of Peter,”</span> beginning and
        ending abruptly, and these have, either by accident or design, been
        bound in the volume upside down and in reverse order, so that, as
        they actually stand, the text commences at page 19 and ends at page
        13. Page 20 is again blank, and the rest of the volume is made up of
        two fragments of the 'Book of Enoch,' the first extending from the
        21st to the 50th page, and the second, written by a different hand,
        from the 51st to the 66th page. Finally, on the inside of the
        binding, and attached to it, is a sheet of parchment on which is
        written in uncials a fragment of the Greek <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Acts of St. Julian,”</span> though which St. Julian
        amongst those in the Calendar does not appear.</p>

        were edited by M. Bouriant. These precious works remained, therefore,
        practically hidden from the world for five or six years after their
        discovery, in consequence of what is vaguely, but truly, described as
        <span class="tei tei-q">“vexatious delays,”</span> whilst the
        comparatively uninteresting arithmetical work preceded them by more
        than a year. The fragments of the <span class=

        "tei tei-q">“Apocalypse”</span> of Peter, long known by references or
        quotations by the Fathers, make us acquainted, for the first time,
        with the writings themselves, and the fragments of the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Book of Enoch”</span> give us the Greek text of part of
        an early work quoted by the writer of the Epistle of Jude, hitherto
        only extant in an Ethiopian version.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of almost greater
        interest than the actual discovery of these and other precious MSS.
        from time to time, in a similar way, is the possibility and
        probability opened out to us that we may yet recover from the dead
        still more precious works than these. The cemetery of Akhmîm stands
        near the ancient and very important city of Panopolis, and from a
        very early period it was the centre of a considerable Christian
        population. The custom of burying with the dead books which were a
        valued possession during life was probably a survival of the same
        primitive custom in accordance with which also a warrior's horse and
        dog and his weapons were interred with him to serve him again in the
        world of spirits. That books, at a time when their multiplication was
        so slow, should have been interred with their dead possessor is not
        only curious but very fortunate for us, and we may yet thank the
        cemetery of Akhmîm for preserving safely for us manuscripts which in
        no other way could have escaped the effects of time and the ravages
        of barbarism.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page005">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The fragments with
        which we are dealing present some peculiarities which deserve a
        moment's notice. The Gospel according to Peter commences in the
        middle of a sentence, but being at the top of a page it is probably
        only part of a manuscript of which the earlier portion was either
        lost or belonged to some one else. The fragment, however, ends
        abruptly in the middle of a phrase and, being followed by blank
        pages, the reasonable presumption is that the scribe intended to
        complete the transcription, but for some reason did not do so. It is
        curious that in a similar way the <span class="tei tei-q">“Apocalypse
        of Peter”</span> is only a fragment, beginning and ending abruptly,
        with a page left blank for continuation. Did the scribe hastily copy
        stray leaves of each work, which had fortuitously come in his way,
        leaving room for more should he be able to secure the rest? or did he
        break off his copy of the one to take up the other, and with equal
        restlessness leave it also unfinished? We shall never know exactly,
        but considering the value of books at that epoch, the probability
        seems to be that he hastily copied such portions of writings as had
        come into his possession, time or accident preventing the completion
        of his task.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The fragment of
        the <span class="tei tei-q">“Gospel”</span> of course does not bear
        any name or superscription—nor, indeed, does the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Apocalypse”</span>—but the title is clearly deduced from
        the work itself, the writer saying directly <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“but I, Simon Peter,”</span> and thus proving that the
        narrative takes the form of a composition by that Apostle. It may be
        remarked, merely in passing, that it is a curious—if not in any way a
        significant—fact that the two Christian fragments in this little
        volume should both profess to have been written by the Apostle Peter.
        Are the peculiarities of the fragments which we have described due to
        the passage of some one having in his possession <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page006">[pg 006]</span><a name="Pg006" id="Pg006"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> two works selected as being believed to
        emanate from the chief of the Apostles, from which there was only
        time to make these extracts? There is some reason for thinking that
        the parchment may have previously been used for some other writing,
        obliterated to make way for these fragments. The little volume has
        not altogether escaped injury in its long rest by the side of the
        dead, and parts of the text have had to be supplied by conjecture;
        but, on the whole, the writing is fairly legible and, by the
        invaluable aid of photography, it has been copied and published with
        complete fidelity. Before this was done, that the first transcription
        by M. Bouriant should have contained errors and omissions which led
        scholars into mistaken conclusions is very intelligible, but the text
        may now be considered fairly settled, and the following is a rather
        close and unpolished translation of the <span class=

        Jews no man washed his hands, neither Herod nor any one of his
        judges; and as they were not minded to wash, Pilate rose. (2) And
        then Herod the King commandeth the Lord to be taken, saying unto
        them: <span class="tei tei-q">“Whatsoever I commanded that ye should
        do, that do unto him.”</span> (3) But there was there Joseph, the
        friend of Pilate and of the Lord, and knowing that they are about to
        crucify him, he came to Pilate and asked the body of the Lord for
        burial. (4) And Pilate sent to Herod and asked for his body. (5) And
        Herod said: <span class="tei tei-q">“Brother Pilate, even if no one
        had begged for him, we should have buried him; because the Sabbath is
        at hand; for it is written in the Law: <span class="tei tei-q">‘The
        sun must not go down upon one put to death.’</span> ”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(6) And he
        delivered him to the people before the first day of the Unleavened
        bread of their feast. And taking the Lord they pushed him hurrying
        along, and said: <span class="tei tei-q">“Let us drag along the Son
        of God as we have power over him.”</span> (7) And they clad him with
        purple and set him on a seat of judgment, saying: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Judge justly, King of Israel.”</span> (8) And one of
        them brought a crown of thorns and set it upon the head of the Lord.
        (9) And others standing by spat upon his eyes, and others smote him
        on the cheeks; others pierced him with a reed, and some scourged him,
        saying: <span class="tei tei-q">“With this honour honour we the Son
        of God.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page008">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(10) And they
        brought two malefactors and crucified between them the Lord; but he
        kept silence as feeling no pain. (11) And as they set up the cross
        they wrote thereon: <span class="tei tei-q">“This is the King of
        Israel.”</span> (12) And they laid the clothes before him and
        distributed them and cast lots for them. (13) But one of these
        malefactors reproved them, saying: <span class="tei tei-q">“We have
        suffered this for the evil which we wrought, but this man who has
        become the Saviour of men, what wrong hath he done you?”</span> (14)
        And they were angry with him, and they commanded that his legs should
        not be broken, in order that he might die in torment.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(15) Now it was
        mid-day, and a darkness covered all Judaea, and they were troubled
        and anxious lest the sun should have set whilst he still lived, for
        it is written for them: <span class="tei tei-q">“The sun must not go
        down upon one put to death.”</span> (16) And one of them said:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Give him to drink gall with vinegar;”</span>
        and having mixed, they gave him to drink. (17) And they fulfilled all
        things and completed their sins upon their own head. (18) Now many
        went about with lights, thinking that it was night, and some fell.
        (19) And the Lord cried aloud, saying; <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Power, my Power, thou hast forsaken me!”</span> and
        having spoken, he was taken up. (20) And the same hour the veil of
        the temple of Jerusalem was torn in twain.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(21) And then they
        took out the nails from the hands of the Lord, and laid him upon the
        earth; and the whole earth quaked, and great fear came [upon them].
        (22) Then did the sun shine out, and it was found to be the ninth
        hour. (23) Now the Jews were glad and gave his body to Joseph, that
        he might bury it, for he had beheld the good works that he did. (24)
        And he took the Lord and washed him, and wrapped him in linen, and
        brought him into his own grave, called <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Joseph's Garden.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(25) Then the Jews
        and the elders and the priests, seeing the evil they had done to
        themselves, began to beat their <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page009">[pg 009]</span><a name="Pg009" id="Pg009" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> breasts and to say: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Woe for our sins: judgment draweth nigh and the end of
        Jerusalem.”</span> (26) And I, with my companions, was mourning, and
        being pierced in spirit we hid ourselves; for we were sought for by
        them as malefactors, and as desiring to burn the temple. (27) Over
        all these things, however, we were fasting, and sat mourning and
        weeping night and day until the Sabbath.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(28) But the
        scribes and Pharisees and elders assembled themselves together,
        hearing that all the people murmured and beat their breasts, saying:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“If at his death these great signs have
        happened, behold how just a one he is.”</span> (29) The elders were
        afraid and came to Pilate beseeching him and saying: (30)
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Give us soldiers that we may watch his grave
        for three days, lest his disciples come and steal him, and the people
        believe that he rose from the dead and do us evil.”</span> (31)
        Pilate, therefore, gave them Petronius the centurion with soldiers to
        watch the tomb, and with them came the elders and scribes to the
        grave. (32) And they rolled a great stone against the centurion and
        the soldiers and set it, all who were there together, at the door of
        the grave. (33) And they put seven seals; and setting up a tent there
        they kept guard. (34) And in the morning, at the dawn of the Sabbath,
        came a multitude from Jerusalem and the neighbourhood in order that
        they might see the sealed-up grave.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(35) Now, in the
        night before the dawn of the Lord's day, whilst the soldiers were
        keeping guard over the place, two and two in a watch, there was a
        great voice in the heaven. (36) And they saw the heavens opened and
        two men come down from thence with great light and approach the tomb.
        (37) And the stone which had been laid at the door rolled of itself
        away by the side, and the tomb was opened and both the young men
        entered.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page010">[pg
        010]</span><a name="Pg010" id="Pg010" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(38) Then those
        soldiers, seeing this, awakened the centurion and the elders, for
        they also were keeping watch. (39) And whilst they were narrating to
        them what they had seen, they beheld again three men coming out of
        the tomb and the two were supporting the one, and a cross following
        them. (40) And the heads of the two indeed reached up to the heaven,
        but that of him that was led by (41) their hands rose above the
        heavens. And they heard a voice from the heavens, saying:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Hast thou preached to them that are
        sleeping?”</span> (42) And an answer was heard from the cross:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Yea.”</span> (43) These, therefore, took
        counsel together whether they should go and declare these things to
        Pilate. (44) And whilst they were still considering, the heavens
        again appeared opened, and a certain man descending and going into
        the grave.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(45) Seeing these
        things, the centurion and his men hastened to Pilate by night,
        leaving the tomb they were watching, and narrated all things they had
        seen, fearing greatly and saying: (46) <span class="tei tei-q">“Truly
        he was a Son of God.”</span> Pilate answered and said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I am pure of the blood of the Son of God, but thus it
        seemed good unto you.”</span> (47) Then they all came to him
        beseeching and entreating him that he should command the centurion
        and the soldiers to say nothing of what they had seen. (48)
        <span class="tei tei-q">“For it is better,”</span> they said,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“to lay upon us the greatest sins before God,
        and not to fall into the hands of the people of the Jews and be
        stoned.”</span> (49) Pilate, therefore, commanded the centurion and
        the soldiers to say nothing.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(50) In the
        morning of the Lord's day, Mary Magdalene, a disciple of the Lord
        (through fear of the Jews, for they burnt with anger, she had not
        done at the grave of the Lord that which women are accustomed to do
        for those that die and are loved by them), (51) took her women
        friends with her and came to the grave where he was laid. (52) And
        they feared lest the Jews should see <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page011">[pg 011]</span><a name="Pg011" id="Pg011" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> them, and said: <span class="tei tei-q">“If we
        could not on that day in which he was crucified weep and lament, let
        us do these things even now at his grave. (53) But who will roll us
        away the stone that is laid at the door of the grave, in order that
        we may enter and set ourselves by him and do the things that are due?
        (54) For great was the stone, and we fear lest some one should see
        us. And if we should not be able to do it, let us at least lay down
        before the door that which we bring in his memory, and let us weep
        and lament till we come to our house.”</span> (55) And they went and
        found the tomb opened and, coming near, they stooped down and see
        there a certain young man sitting in the midst of the tomb, beautiful
        and clad in a shining garment, who said to them: (56) <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Why are ye come? Whom seek ye? Him who was crucified? He
        is risen and gone away. But if ye do not believe, stoop down and see
        the place where he lay, that he is not there; for he is risen and
        gone away thither whence he was sent.”</span> (57) Then the women,
        frightened, fled.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(58) And it was
        the last day of the Unleavened bread, and many went forth, returning
        to their homes, the feast being ended. (59) But we, the twelve
        disciples of the Lord, wept and mourned, and each went to his home
        sorrowing for that which had happened. (60) But I, Simon Peter, and
        Andrew, my brother, took our nets and went to the sea, and there was

        work, well worth serious examination. The first question which

          we call Docetae—for most of its thoughts are of this sect—having
          procured it from them, I was able to go through it, and to find,
          indeed, that most was according to the right teaching of the

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is little or
        no doubt that the writing before us is a fragment of this
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Gospel according to Peter”</span> of which
        Serapion writes.<a id="noteref_7" name="noteref_7" href=
        "#note_7"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">7</span></span></a> It must
        always be remembered, as we examine the evidence for the work, that
        we have here only a short fragment, and that it would not be
        reasonable to expect to find in it materials for a perfect
        identification of the work with references to it in <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page014">[pg 014]</span><a name="Pg014" id="Pg014"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> writings of the Fathers. Within the few
        pages which we possess, however, there is sufficient justification
        for concluding that they formed part of the Gospel current in
        Rhossus. Only one <span class="tei tei-q">“Gospel according to
        Peter”</span> is mentioned by early writers. This fragment distinctly
        pretends to be a narrative of Simon Peter; and its matter is
        generally such as must have satisfied Serapion's ideas of orthodox
        doctrine, if suspicion of Docetic tendencies had not made him believe
        that it contained a superadded leaven of heresy. This may not appear
        very clearly in the fragment, but we know from other sources, as we
        shall presently see, that they existed in the Gospel, and even here
        the representation that Jesus suffered no pain; that he is always
        called <span class="tei tei-q">“the Lord,”</span> or the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Son of God;”</span> that his one cry on the cross was
        susceptible of peculiar explanation, and that he was immediately
        <span class="tei tei-q">“taken up,”</span> whilst his body
        subsequently presents aspects not common to the canonical Gospels,
        may have seemed to the careful bishop sufficiently Docetic to warrant
        at least his not very severe condemnation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is unnecessary
        to discuss minutely the details of Serapion's letter, which, if vague
        in parts and open to considerable doubt in some important respects,
        is at least sufficiently clear for our purpose in its general
        meaning. Nothing is known of the Marcianus to whom it refers. The
        bishop had evidently previously written of him, but the context has
        not been preserved. The Armenian version, made from a Syriac text,
        reads <span class="tei tei-q">“Marcion”</span> for <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Marcianus,”</span> but it would be premature on this
        authority to associate the episode with that arch-heretic of the
        second century. It is clear from the bishop's words that on his
        previous visit to Rhossus, at the desire of part of the community, he
        sanctioned the public reading of the Gospel of Peter but, after
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page015">[pg 015]</span><a name="Pg015"
        id="Pg015" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> personal acquaintance with its
        contents, he withdrew that permission. Zahn<a id="noteref_8" name=
        "noteref_8" href="#note_8"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">8</span></span></a> maintains
        that the private reading by members of the Christian community, and
        not public reading at the services of the Church, is dealt with in
        this letter, but in this he stands alone. The <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Index
        expurgatorius</span></span> had not been commenced in the second
        century, and it is impossible to think that the sanction of a bishop
        was either sought or required for the private reading of individuals.
        We have here only an instance of the diversity of custom, as regards
        the public reading of early writings, to which reference is made in
        the writings of the Fathers and in the Muratorian and other Canons.
        In this way the Epistle of the Roman Clement, as Eusebius<a id=

        was publicly read in the churches; as were the Epistle of Soter to
        the Corinthians, the <span class="tei tei-q">“Pastor”</span> of
        Hermas,<a id="noteref_10" name="noteref_10" href=

        various Gospels which did not permanently secure a place in the
        Canon. Eusebius, for instance, states that the Ebionites made use
        only of the <span class="tei tei-q">“Gospel according to the
        Hebrews.”</span><a id="noteref_12" name="noteref_12" href=

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        a certain number of works attributed to the Apostle Peter: the first
        Epistle, generally acknowledged as genuine, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“but that which is called the second,”</span> he says,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“we have not understood to be incorporated
        with the testament”</span> (ἐνδιάθηκον). The other works are, the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Acts of Peter,”</span> the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Gospel according to Peter,”</span> the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Preaching of Peter,”</span> and the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Apocalypse of Peter,”</span> the last being doubtless
        the work of which a fragment has now been discovered in the little
        volume which contains the fragment of the Gospel which we are
        considering. Of these Eusebius says that he does not know of their
        being handed <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page016">[pg
        016]</span><a name="Pg016" id="Pg016" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Gospel according to Peter”</span> is directly referred
        to by Origen in his Commentary on Matthew. He says: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Some say, with regard to the brethren of Jesus, from a
        tradition in the Gospel entitled according to Peter, or of the Book
        of James, that they were sons of Joseph by a former
        wife.”</span><a id="noteref_14" name="noteref_14" href=

        this statement does not in itself necessarily favour Docetic views,
        it is quite intelligible that it might be used in support of them
        and, therefore, might have been one of the passages which excited the
        suspicion of Serapion, more especially as a clear statement of this
        family relationship is not to be found in the canonical Gospels. The
        part of the Gospel referred to by Origen is not, unfortunately,
        contained in the fragment, and consequently cannot be verified, but
        it is quite in accordance with its general spirit, and at least we
        have here a distinct mention of the Gospel without any expression of
        unfavourable opinion. What is more important still is the fact that
        Origen certainly made use of the Gospel, amongst others,
        himself.<a id="noteref_15" name="noteref_15" href=

        refers to it, after repeating the tradition that the Gospel was said
        to be Peter's, which Mark composed, who was his hearer and
        interpreter; and to the works ascribed to Peter, which Eusebius
        enumerates, he adds another—the <span class="tei tei-q">“Judgment of
        Peter,”</span> of which little or nothing is known.</p>

        against the correctness of this statement; but reasoning of this
        kind, based upon supposed differences of views, is not very
        convincing, when we consider that inferences to be drawn from
        peculiarities in the narrative in this Gospel are neither so
        distinct, nor so inevitable, as to be forced upon a simple and
        uncritical community, and probably that the anti-Judaistic tendency
        of the whole, the strongest characteristic of the composition,
        secured its acceptance, and diverted attention from any less marked
        tendencies.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A number of
        passages have been pointed out in the Didascalia and Apostolical
        Constitutions, Origen, Cyril of Jerusalem, Dionysius of Alexandria,
        and other ancient writers, showing the use of this Gospel according
        to Peter;<a id="noteref_19" name="noteref_19" href=

        these later testimonies it is not necessary for us at present to go.
        That the work long continued to exercise considerable influence can
        scarcely be doubted. It is to the earlier history of the Gospel and
        its use in the second century that we must rather turn our
        attention.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A probable
        reference to the Gospel of Peter in Polycarp's <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Epistle to the Corinthians”</span> has been pointed out
        by Mr. F. C. Conybeare.<a id="noteref_20" name="noteref_20" href=
        "#note_20"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">20</span></span></a> The
        writer speaks of <span class="tei tei-q">“the testimony of the
        cross”</span> (τὸ μαρτύριον τοῦ σταυροῦ), an expression which has
        puzzled critics a good deal. No passage in our Gospels has hitherto
        explained it, but if it be referred to the answer made by the cross,
        in our fragment, to the question from Heaven: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Hast thou preached to them that are sleeping? And an
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page018">[pg 018]</span><a name="Pg018"
        id="Pg018" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> answer came from the cross,
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘Yea,’</span> ”</span> it becomes at once
        intelligible. Mr. Taylor<a id="noteref_21" name="noteref_21" href=
        "#note_21"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">21</span></span></a> suggests
        the question whether <span class="tei tei-q">“the word of the
        cross”</span> (ὁ λόγος τοῦ σταυροῦ) in 1 Cor. i. 18 is not also
        connected with the same tradition of the speaking cross and, as Mr.
        Conybeare points out, the context favours the idea, although he
        himself is not inclined to admit the interpretation. The words of
        Paul are worth quoting:</p>

        <div class="block tei tei-quote" style=
        "margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">
        <span style="font-size: 90%">For the word of the cross is to them
        that are perishing foolishness; but unto us which are being saved it
        is the power of God. 19. For it is written:</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style=

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">and so on. But
        although he cannot agree in the suggestion that Paul refers to this
        tradition, because, he says, <span class="tei tei-q">“Such a view
        seems to me to be too bold and innovating in its character,”</span>
        Mr. Conybeare goes on to suggest that the incident in Peter, with
        this reply to the voice from heaven, may be</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These suggestions
        are quoted here, in dealing with Polycarp, to show that the
        supposition that he refers to the answer of the cross in the Gospel
        of Peter is not without support in other early writings. When it is
        remembered that the doctrine of a descent into Hell has a place in
        the Creed of Christendom, it is not surprising that it should be
        dwelt on in early writings, and that a Gospel which proclaims it by a
        voice from <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page019">[pg
        019]</span><a name="Pg019" id="Pg019" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        Heaven, coupled with a miraculous testimony from the cross, should be
        referred to. Of course it is impossible, in the absence of any
        explicit declaration, to establish by the passage we are discussing
        that the Gospel according to Peter was used by Polycarp, but there is
        some probability of it at least, since no other Gospel contains the
        episode to which the writer seems to refer.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We may now
        consider whether Justin Martyr was acquainted with it, and here again
        it may be well to remind the reader that we have only a small
        fragment of the Gospel according to Peter to compare with the
        allusions to be found in writings of the Fathers. In these early
        works, few quotations are made with any direct mention of the source
        from which they were taken, and as only those parts of Patristic
        writings which deal with the trial, crucifixion and resurrection of
        Jesus can be expected to present analogies with our fragment, it will
        readily be seen how limited the range of testimony must naturally be.
        Justin Martyr is usually supposed to have died about <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 163-165,<a id=

        first <span class="tei tei-q">“Apology”</span> may be dated
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 147, and the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Dialogue with Trypho”</span> somewhat later.
        In these writings, Justin very frequently refers to facts, and to
        sayings of Jesus, making, indeed, some hundred and fifty quotations
        of this kind from certain <span class="tei tei-q">“Memoirs of the
        Apostles”</span> (ἀπομνημονεύματα τῶν ἀποστόλων), all of which differ
        more or less from our present canonical Gospels. He never mentions
        the name of any author of these Memoirs, if indeed he was acquainted
        with one, unless it be upon one occasion, which is of peculiar
        interest in connection with our fragment. The instance to which we
        refer is the following. Justin says: <span class="tei tei-q">“The
        statement also that <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page021">[pg

        [Jesus] changed the name of Peter, one of the Apostles, and that this
        is written in his [Peter's] Memoirs as having been done, together
        with the fact that he also changed the name of other two brothers,

        of course, argued that the αὐτοῦ here does not refer to Peter but to
        Jesus; or that the word should be amended to αὐτῶν and applied to the
        Apostles; but the majority of critics naturally decided against such
        royal ways of removing difficulties, and were forced to admit a
        reference to <span class="tei tei-q">“Memoirs of Peter.”</span>
        Hitherto, the apologetic explanation has been that the allusion of
        Justin must have been to the second Synoptic, generally referred to
        Mark, who was held by many of the Fathers to be the mere mouthpiece
        and <span class="tei tei-q">“interpreter of Peter,”</span> and that
        this reference is supported by the fact that the Gospel according to
        Mark is the only one of the four canonical works which narrates these
        changes of name. This argument, however, is disposed of by the fact
        that our second Synoptic cannot possibly be considered the work
        referred to in the tradition of Papias.<a id="noteref_25" name=
        "noteref_25" href="#note_25"><span class=

        Returning to Justin, we find that he designates the source of his
        quotations ten times as <span class="tei tei-q">“Memoirs of the
        Apostles;”</span> five times he calls it simply <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Memoirs,”</span> and upon one occasion only explains
        that they were written <span class="tei tei-q">“by his Apostles and
        their followers.”</span> He never speaks indefinitely of <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Memoirs of Apostles,”</span> but always of the
        collective Apostles, except in the one instance which has been quoted
        above. In a single passage there occurs an expression which must be
        quoted. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page022">[pg 022]</span><a name=
        "Pg022" id="Pg022" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Justin says:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“For the Apostles in the Memoirs composed by
        them, which are called Gospels,”</span> &amp;c.<a id="noteref_26"
        name="noteref_26" href="#note_26"><span class=

        καλεῖται εὐαγγέλια has very much the appearance of a gloss in the
        margin of some MS., which has afterwards been transferred to the text
        by a scribe, as scholars have before now suggested; but in any case
        it makes little difference in the argument.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is obvious that
        the name <span class="tei tei-q">“Memoirs”</span> cannot with any
        degree of propriety be applied to our canonical Gospels; but the
        discovery of this fragment, which is distinctly written as a personal
        narrative, throws fresh light upon the subject, and the title
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Memoirs of Peter,”</span> would exactly
        describe the form in which the Gospel is written. It may further be
        suggested whether it does not give us reason for conjecturing that
        the earlier documents, from which our Gospels were composed, were
        similarly personal narratives or memoirs of those who took part in
        early Christian development. The tradition preserved to us by Papias
        distinctly points in this direction:</p>

        <div class="block tei tei-quote" style=

        <span style="font-size: 90%">This also the Presbyter said: Mark
        having become the interpreter of Peter, wrote accurately whatever he
        remembered, though he did not arrange in order the things which were
        either said or done by Christ. For he neither heard the Lord, nor
        followed him; but afterwards, as I said, accompanied Peter, who
        adapted his teaching to the occasion, and not as making a consecutive
        record of the Lord's oracles.</span><a id="noteref_27" name=
        "noteref_27" href="#note_27"><span class=

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There can be very
        little doubt that the first teaching of Apostles and early catechists
        must have taken the form of personal recollections of various
        episodes of Christian history and reports of discourses and parables,
        with an account of the circumstances under which they were delivered.
        This familiar and less impressive mode of tracing Christian history
        must gradually have been <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page023">[pg
        023]</span><a name="Pg023" id="Pg023" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        eliminated from successive forms of the story drawn up for the use of
        the growing Church, until, in the Gospels adopted into the Canon, it
        had entirely disappeared. In the fourth Gospel, a slight trace of it
        remains in the reference in the third person to the writer, and it is
        present in parts of the Apocalypse; but a more marked instance is to
        be found in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Acts of the
        Apostles;”</span> not so much in the prologue—which, of course, is
        not really part of the book—where the author distinctly speaks in the
        first person, as in the narrative after the call to Macedonia (xvi.
        10-17), where the writer falls into the use of the first person
        plural (ἡμεῖς), resumes it after a break (xx. 5-15), and abandons it
        again, till it is recommenced in xxi. 1-18, xxvii. 1, xxviii. 16. As
        the author doubtless made use of written sources of information, like
        the writers of our Gospels, it is most probable that, in these
        portions of the Acts, he simply inserted portions of personal written
        narratives which had come into his possession. The Gospel according
        to Peter, which escaped the successive revisals of the canonical
        Gospels, probably presents the more original form of such histories.
        We are, of course, unable to say whether the change of names referred
        to by Justin was recorded in earlier portions of this Gospel which
        have not been recovered, but the use of the double name, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I, Simon Peter,”</span> favours the supposition that it
        was.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Without attaching
        undue importance to it, it may be well to point out—in connection
        with Origen's statement that, in the Gospel according to Peter, the
        brethren of Jesus are represented as being of a previous
        marriage—that the only genealogy of Jesus which is recognised by
        Justin is traced through the Virgin Mary, and excludes Joseph.<a id=
        "noteref_28" name="noteref_28" href="#note_28"><span class=

        024]</span><a name="Pg024" id="Pg024" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and from the house of David. The genealogy
        of Jesus in the canonical Gospels, on the contrary, is traced solely
        through Joseph, who alone is stated to be of the lineage of David.
        The genealogies of the first and third Synoptics, though differing in
        several important particulars, at least agree in excluding Mary. In
        the third Gospel Joseph goes to Judæa <span class="tei tei-q">“unto
        the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the
        house and lineage of David.”</span><a id="noteref_29" name=

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">29</span></span></a> Justin
        simply states that Joseph went <span class="tei tei-q">“to Bethlehem
        ... for his descent was from the tribe of Judah, which inhabited that
        region.”</span><a id="noteref_30" name="noteref_30" href=
        "#note_30"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">30</span></span></a> Justin
        could not, therefore, derive his genealogies from the canonical
        Gospels; and his Memoirs, from which he learns the Davidic descent
        through Mary only, to which he refers no less than eleven times,
        differed from them distinctly on this point. The Gospel according to
        Peter, which, according to Origen, contained a statement which
        separated Jesus from his brethren in the flesh, in all probability
        must have traced the Davidic descent through Mary. The Gospel of
        James, commonly called the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Protevangelium,”</span> to a form of which, at least,
        Origen refers at the same time as the Gospel according to Peter,
        states that Mary was of the lineage of David.<a id="noteref_31" name=
        "noteref_31" href="#note_31"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">31</span></span></a> There
        are other peculiarities in Justin's account of the angelic
        announcement to Mary differing distinctly from our canonical
        Gospels,<a id="noteref_32" name="noteref_32" href=

        regarding some of which Tischendorf was of opinion that they were
        derived from the <span class="tei tei-q">“Protevangelium;”</span> but
        there are reasons for supposing that they may have come from a still
        older work, and if it should seem that Justin made use of the Gospel
        according to Peter, these may also have been taken from it.
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page025">[pg 025]</span><a name="Pg025"
        id="Pg025" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> In the absence of the rest of
        the Gospel, however, all this must be left for the present as mere
        conjecture.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The fragment
        begins with a broken sentence presenting an obviously different story
        of the trial of Jesus from that of the canonical Gospels.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“... but of the Jews no man (τῶν δὲ Ἰουδαίων
        οὐδεὶς) washed his hands, neither Herod (οὐδὲ Ἡρῴδης) nor any of his
        judges.... Pilate rose up (ἀνέστη Πειλᾶτος). And then Herod the King
        (Ἡρῴδης ὁ βασιλεὺς) commandeth the Lord to be taken,”</span> &amp;c.
        Justin in one place<a id="noteref_33" name="noteref_33" href=
        "#note_33"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">33</span></span></a> refers
        to this trial as foretold by the prophetic spirit, and speaks of what
        was done against the Christ <span class="tei tei-q">“by Herod the
        King of the Jews, and the Jews themselves, and Pilate who was your
        governor among them, and his soldiers”</span> (Ἡρώδου τοῦ βασιλέως
        Ἰουδαίων καὶ αὐτῶν Ἰουδαίων καὶ Πιλάτου τοῦ ὑμετέρου παρ᾽ αὐτοῖς
        γενομένου ἐπιτρόπου σὺν τοῖς αὐτοῦ στρατιώταις). This combination
        agrees with the representation of the fragment, and of course differs
        from that of the Gospels. In Dial. ciii. Justin repeats this to some
        extent, adding that he sent Jesus <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“bound”</span> (δεδεμένον). This representation does not
        exist in Luke, but neither is it found in what we have of the Gospel
        according to Peter, though it may have occurred in the commencement
        of the scene to which we are so abruptly introduced.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Justin says in
        another place: <span class="tei tei-q">“For as the prophet said,

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">36</span></span></a> This
        representation is different from any in our Gospels, and it has some
        singular points of agreement with our fragment. It has frequently
        been suggested that Justin, in this passage, makes use of our
        canonical Gospels with a combination of the Septuagint version of
        Isaiah lviii. 2, 3, and that this is supported by the expression
        <span class="tei tei-q">“as said the prophet.”</span> This does not
        sufficiently explain the passage, however. The Septuagint version of
        the part of Isaiah lviii. 2 referred to reads: αἰτοῦσίν με νῦν κρίσιν
        δικαίαν—<span class="tei tei-q">“They ask me now for just
        judgment.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Justin drops the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“just,”</span> which stands both in Isaiah
        and in the fragment, and therefore the omission may be considered
        equally unfavourable to both writings as the source. In other
        respects Justin is nearer the Gospel than the prophet. On the other
        hand, the proposed use of καθίζειν as a transitive verb would make
        the fourth Gospel, xix. 13, read: <span class="tei tei-q">“Pilate ...
        brought Jesus out, and set him (ἐκάθισεν) upon a judgment seat (ἐπὶ
        βήματος),”</span> &amp;c.; and it is pretended that Justin may have
        taken it in this sense, and that by the use of the word βῆμα he
        betrays his indebtedness to the fourth Gospel. This use of the verb,
        however, can scarcely be maintained. It is impossible to suppose that
        Pilate himself set Jesus on a judgment seat, as this transitive use
        of ἐκάθισε would require us to receive; and we must, more especially
        in the absence of a distinct <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page027">[pg 027]</span><a name="Pg027" id="Pg027" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> object, receive it as the Revisers of the New
        Testament have rightly done—intransitively: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“He brought Jesus out and sat down.”</span><a id=

        Justin it is not Pilate but the Jews who drag Jesus along, and put
        him on a judgment seat, and the use of the ordinary βῆμα for the
        expression of the fragment, <span class="tei tei-q">“a seat of
        judgment”</span> (καθέδρα κρίσεως), is not surprising in a writer
        like Justin, who is not directly quoting, but merely giving the sense
        of a passage. However this may be, the whole representation is
        peculiar, and the conclusion of many critics is that it proves
        Justin's dependence on the Gospel according to Peter.<a id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Justin, speaking
        of an incident of the crucifixion, says: <span class="tei tei-q">“And
        those who were crucifying him parted his garments (ἐμερίσαν τὰ ἱμάτια
        αὐτοῦ) amongst themselves, casting lots (λαχμὸν βάλλοντες), each
        taking what pleased him, according to the cast of the lot (τοῦ

        they laid the clothes (τὰ ἐνδύματα) before him, and distributed them
        (διεμερίσαντο), and cast lots (λαχμὸν ἔβαλον) for them.”</span> The
        use of the peculiar expression λαχμὸν βάλλειν both by the Gospel and
        Justin is undoubtedly striking, especially, as Dr. Swete properly
        points out, as its use in this connection is limited, so far as we
        know, to the Gospel of Peter, Justin, and Cyril.<a id="noteref_40"

        fact that, both in the Gospel and Justin, the casting of lots is
        applied to all the clothes, in contradistinction to the fourth
        Gospel, in which it is connected with the coat alone, and that
        neither has any mention of the Johannine peculiarity that the coat
        was without seam.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Justin says that

        from the grave (κλέψαντες αὐτὸν ἀπὸ τοῦ μνήματος νυκτός) where he had

        thou hast forsaken me,’</span> and having spoken, he was taken
        up.”</span> This is one of the most striking variations from the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page029">[pg 029]</span><a name="Pg029"
        id="Pg029" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> canonical Gospels. It is also
        claimed as, perhaps, the most Docetic representation of the fragment,
        for the idea was that one Christ suffered and rose, and another flew
        up and was free from suffering.<a id="noteref_46" name="noteref_46"
        href="#note_46"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">46</span></span></a> It was
        believed by the Docetae that the Holy Spirit only descended upon the
        human Jesus, at his baptism, in the shape of a dove. Now one of the
        statements of Justin from his Memoirs, which has no existence in our
        Gospels, was that, when Jesus went to be baptized by John,</p>

        <div class="block tei tei-quote" style=
        "margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">
        <span style="font-size: 90%">As Jesus went down to the water, a fire
        was also kindled in the Jordan; and when he came up from the water,
        the Holy Spirit like a dove fell upon him, as the Apostles of this
        very Christ of ours wrote ... and at the same time a voice came from
        the heavens ...</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style=

        son, this day have I begotten thee.</span><span style=
        "font-size: 90%">”</span></span>
        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Justin repeats his
        version of the words a second time in the same chapter.<a id=
        "noteref_47" name="noteref_47" href="#note_47"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">47</span></span></a> The
        Synoptics make the voice say: <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou art my
        beloved son; in thee I am well pleased,”</span> instead of the words
        from Psalm ii. 7. Now, although we have not the part of the Gospel
        according to Peter in which the earlier history of Jesus is related,
        it is not improbable that Justin's version, agreeing as it does with
        the later episode in the fragment and with the criticism of Serapion,
        was taken from this Gospel.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We refer to this
        point, however, for the purpose of introducing another statement of
        Justin, which may be worth a little consideration in connection with
        our fragment. One of the passages which are supposed most clearly to
        betray Docetic tendencies is the expression, <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">v.</span></span> 10,
        that when the Lord was crucified <span class="tei tei-q">“he kept
        silence, as feeling no pain”</span> (ὡς μηδὲν πόνον ἔχων). It is
        evident that these words may either be taken as simply representing
        the fortitude with which suffering was endured, or understood to
        support the view <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page030">[pg
        030]</span><a name="Pg030" id="Pg030" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        that no pain was really suffered, though this is by no means actually
        said. Now, Justin, in another chapter of his <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Dialogue with Trypho,”</span> in which he again refers
        to the baptism and quotes the words of the voice as above, cites the
        agony in the garden to prove that <span class="tei tei-q">“the Father
        wished his Son really to suffer (πάθεσιν ἀληθῶς) for our sakes, and
        that we may not say that he, being the Son of God, did not feel what
        was happening and being inflicted upon him.”</span><a id="noteref_48"
        name="noteref_48" href="#note_48"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">48</span></span></a> He goes
        on to say that the silence of Jesus, who returned no answer to any
        one in the presence of Pilate, was foretold in a passage which he
        quotes. All this, in connection with representations not found in our
        canonical Gospels, may form another link with the Gospel according to
        Peter, as one of his Memoirs. Justin evidently made use of passages
        like the words at the baptism, to which he did not attach any Docetic
        interpretation, and it is quite natural that he should argue against
        the view that Jesus did not really suffer pain, and yet read quite
        naturally the words we are discussing, without directly referring to
        them. It was the practice of these early sects to twist passages, not
        originally intended to favour them, into evidence for their views,
        and an ordinary Christian might possess a Gospel containing them, in
        complete unconsciousness that it tended in the slightest degree to
        encourage heresy.<a id="noteref_49" name="noteref_49" href=
        "#note_49"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">49</span></span></a> It is
        evident from several quotations which we have made, and from others
        which might be adduced, that Justin was an example of this very
        thing.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A number of small
        points might be added to these, but we do not go into them here. A
        majority of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page031">[pg
        031]</span><a name="Pg031" id="Pg031" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        critics who have discussed the question are of opinion that Justin
        made use of the Gospel according to Peter,<a id="noteref_50" name=
        "noteref_50" href="#note_50"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">50</span></span></a> and even
        apologists, (who as a body seem agreed to depreciate the fragment),
        whilst refusing to admit its use by Justin, are not generally very
        decided in their denial nor, as we shall presently see, inclined to
        assign it a date which excludes the possibility. The case may be
        summed up in a few words. Justin undeniably quotes from his
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Memoirs of the Apostles”</span> facts and
        passages which are not found in our Gospels; he distinctly refers to
        statements as contained in certain <span class="tei tei-q">“Memoirs
        of Peter;”</span><a id="noteref_51" name="noteref_51" href=
        "#note_51"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">51</span></span></a> some of
        these variations from the canonical Gospels have linguistic and other
        parallels in our fragment, short as it is, and there is reason to
        suppose that others would have been found in it had the entire Gospel
        been extant for comparison; the style of the fragment precisely
        tallies with the peculiar name of <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Memoirs,”</span> being a personal narrative in the first
        person singular; and finally, there is nothing in its composition or
        character which necessitates the assignment of such a date to the
        fragment as would exclude the possibility, or probability, of its use
        by Justin.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We may now
        consider whether there is any indication of the use of this Gospel
        according to Peter by the author of the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Epistle of Barnabas.”</span> The Epistle is variously
        dated between <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 70-132, apologists
        leaning towards the earlier date. The shortness of the fragment
        recovered, of course, diminishes greatly the probability of finding
        any trace of its use in so comparatively brief a work as this
        Epistle, but some indications may be pointed out. The fragment states
        that, being anxious lest the sun should set whilst he was still
        living and the law regarding one put to death be transgressed,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“one of them said: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘Give him to drink gall with vinegar,’</span> and having
        mixed they gave him to drink (Ποτίσατε αὐτὸν χολὴν μετὰ ὄξους; καὶ
        κεράσαντες ἐπότισαν).<a id="noteref_52" name="noteref_52" href=
        "#note_52"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        all these things, however, we were fasting (ἐπὶ δὲ τούτοις πᾶσιν
        ἐνηστεύομεν)<a id="noteref_53" name="noteref_53" href=
        "#note_53"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        "#note_54"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">54</span></span></a> This
        representation not only differs from the canonical Gospels in
        <span class="tei tei-q">“gall with vinegar”</span> being given to
        drink, but in the view that it was not given to relieve thirst, but
        as a potion to hasten death,<a id="noteref_55" name="noteref_55"
        href="#note_55"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">55</span></span></a> and
        there follow various statements regarding fasting <span class=

        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and mourning. Now in Barnabas precisely
        the same representation is made. The Epistle says:</p>

        <div class="block tei tei-quote" style=
        "margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">
        <span style="font-size: 90%">But also when crucified, he had vinegar
        and gall given him to drink (ἀλλὰ καὶ σταυρωθεὶς ἐποτίζετο ὄξει καὶ

        revealed. Seeing that there is a commandment in Scripture:</span>

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are three
        suppositions as the possible explanation of this similarity: (1) that
        the author of the Epistle derived his statement from the Gospel; (2)
        that the author of the Gospel derived it from the Epistle, or (3)
        that both drew it from a third and earlier source. Assigning as we do
        the later date to the Epistle of Barnabas, the first of these
        hypotheses seems to us the most natural and the correct one,
        although, of course, it is impossible to prove that both did not
        derive it from another source. The second explanation we must
        definitely reject, both because we consider that priority of date
        lies with the fragment, and because it does not seem probable that
        the representation originated in the Epistle. To admit this would be
        to suppose that the author first fabricated the statement that Jesus
        was <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page034">[pg 034]</span><a name=
        "Pg034" id="Pg034" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> given gall and vinegar
        to hasten death, and then proceeded immediately to explain the
        circumstance by means of the elaborate gnosis with which the Epistle
        is filled. It is quite undeniable that the whole narrative of the
        Gospels grew out of the suggestions of supposed prophetic passages in
        the Old Testament, but the author of the Epistle introduces the
        statement upon which his explanation is based, with a simplicity
        which seems to exclude the idea of its being his own fabrication:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“But also, when crucified, he had vinegar and
        gall given him to drink.”</span> There is not the ring here of a
        statement advanced for the first time, but if we suppose that the
        author had read it in such a work as the Gospel according to Peter,
        it would be quite natural. It is not to be understood that we doubt
        that the account in the fragment, or in our Gospels, was suggested by
        passages in the Old Testament, but simply that we do not believe that
        the representation originated in this Epistle, in immediate
        connection with the elaborate explanation given. A tradition,
        gradually influenced by such prophetic and other considerations, may
        have been embodied by the author of the Gospel in his narrative, and
        then the writer of the Epistle may have seized upon it and enlarged
        upon its typical signification, but it is not probable that he
        originated it himself.</p>

        to enter here upon an inquiry whether there is any evidence within
        our short fragment that the Gospel according to Peter was used by
        other early writers. The slight traces which alone we could hope to
        find, and which several able critics do find,<a id="noteref_57" name=
        "noteref_57" href="#note_57"><span class=

        be decisive of anything, and whilst there may be a faint literary
        interest in pursuing such researches, they need not detain us here. A
        short consideration may, however, be given to Tatian. Some critics,
        impressed apparently with the idea that no early Gospels can possibly
        be otherwise than dependent on our canonical works, yet having to
        explain the continuous divergence from the canonical narratives,
        advance the suggestion, that the writer of the Gospel according to
        Peter may have derived all the points which the fragment contains, in
        common with one or more of the canonical Gospels, from a Harmony of
        our Gospels. Now, the only Harmony of the second century which, they
        think, has survived is the so-called <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Diatessaron”</span> of Tatian. Of course, they find that
        the <span class="tei tei-q">“Diatessaron”</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“might have furnished the writer of the fragment with all
        the incidents which he shares with any of the Four Gospels.”</span>
        Dr. Swete continues: <span class="tei tei-q">“The order in Peter is
        not always the same as it seems to have been <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page036">[pg 036]</span><a name="Pg036" id="Pg036" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> in Tatian, but differences of order may be
        disregarded in our inquiry, since they are equally embarrassing if we
        assume that the writer had recourse to the Gospels as separate
        books.”</span><a id="noteref_58" name="noteref_58" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Not content with
        the conclusion that the Gospels, narrating the very same history,
        might have furnished the incidents which they have in common, Dr.
        Swete proceeds <span class="tei tei-q">“to compare the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘Diatessaron’</span> with our fragment, with the view of
        ascertaining whether Tatian would have provided the Petrine writer
        with the words which he seems to have adopted from the Four
        Gospels.”</span><a id="noteref_59" name="noteref_59" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is not the
        place to discuss again the identity of the supposed <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Diatessaron,”</span> but it will be sufficient to point
        out that we have it only in an Arabic version, published and
        translated by Ciasca, and a translation of the supposed Armenian
        version of the Commentary upon it, ascribed to Ephraem, which again
        Moesinger, who edited the Latin version published in 1876, declares
        to be itself translated from the Syriac. In these varied
        transformations of the text, anything like verbal accuracy must be
        regarded as totally lost. The object in making the versions was not,
        of course, critical fidelity, and variations from canonical texts
        would, no doubt, often or always be regarded as accidental and to be
        corrected. Such translations can never, in textual criticism, be
        accepted as sufficient representations of the original. The process,
        however, by which Dr. Swete proceeds to ascertain whether the author
        of the fragment derives from Tatian the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">words</span></em>
        which he seems to have adopted from the Four Gospels, is to place
        side by side with the Petrine narrative, in certain crucial passages,
        the corresponding portions of the <span class=

        accounts of the mockery, the three hours, the burial, and the visit
        of the women to the tomb. He thus explains his system: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The plan adopted has been to substitute for Ciasca's
        translation of the Arabic Tatian the corresponding portions of the
        canonical Gospels. The text has been determined by a comparison of
        Ciasca's Latin with Moesinger's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Evangelii Concordantis Expositio</span></span>,
        and the Curetonian Syriac of Luke xxiii., xxiv. It claims, of course,
        only to be an approximate and provisional representation of the text
        of the original work.”</span><a id="noteref_60" name="noteref_60"

        impartial Dr. Swete may have tried to be—and without doubt he did
        endeavour to be so—such a test is vitiated and rendered useless by
        the antecedent manipulation of the texts. The result at which he
        arrives is: <span class="tei tei-q">“This comparison does not justify
        the conclusion that the writer of our fragment was limited to the use
        of the <span class="tei tei-q">‘Diatessaron’</span> ”</span>—the
        exact contents of which, in its original shape, be it noted, Dr.
        Swete, a few lines further on, admits that we do not know,

        <div class="block tei tei-quote" style=

        <span style="font-size: 90%">On the whole we may perhaps claim to
        have established a strong presumption that the Petrine writer
        employed a Harmony which, in its general selection of extracts, and
        in some of its minuter arrangements, very nearly resembled the
        Harmony of Tatian. This is not equivalent to saying that he used
        Tatian, because there is some reason to think that there may have
        been a Harmony or Harmonies earlier than Tatian.... Thus the relation
        of the Petrine writer to Tatian remains for the present an open
        question; but enough has been said to render such a relation
        probable, if further inquiries should lead us to place the Gospel of
        Peter after the publication of the</span> <span class=

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It must frankly be
        asserted that the whole of this comparison with Tatian, and the views
        so curiously expressed regarding the result, are the outcome of a
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page038">[pg 038]</span><a name="Pg038"
        id="Pg038" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> preconceived idea that the
        Petrine author compiled his Gospel mainly from the canonical. The
        divergencies being so great, however, and the actual contradictions
        so strong, it becomes necessary to account for them in some way, and
        the theory of the use of a Harmony is advanced to see whether it may
        not overcome some of the difficulties. It would have been more to the
        purpose to have inquired whether the so-called <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Diatessaron”</span> did not make use of the Gospel
        according to Peter, amongst others.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In connection with
        this it may be well to refer to some remarkable observations of
        Professor J. Rendel Harris regarding the relation of the Gospel
        according to Peter and Tatian's Harmony. When the fragment was first
        discovered, he was naturally struck by its great importance.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“The Gospel of Peter, even in the imperfect
        form in which it has come down to us, is the breaking of a new seal,
        the opening of a fresh door,”</span> he said, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“to those who are engaged in the problems presented by
        Biblical and Patristic criticism,”</span><a id="noteref_62" name=
        "noteref_62" href="#note_62"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">62</span></span></a> and he
        very rightly proceeded to try to find out <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“whether Peter has used Tatian, or Tatian Peter, or
        whether both of them are working upon common sources.”</span><a id=
        "noteref_63" name="noteref_63" href="#note_63"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">63</span></span></a> He first
        refers to <span class="tei tei-q">“a curious addition to the story of
        the Crucifixion, which can be shown, with a very high probability, to
        have once stood in the Harmony of Tatian.”</span> The most
        interesting and instructive part of the reference is that Mr. Harris
        had made and published, some years before the discovery of the
        fragment before us, certain notes on the Harmony of Tatian, in which
        he had employed <span class="tei tei-q">“the method of combination of
        passages in different writers who were known to have used the
        Harmony, or different texts which were suspected of having borrowed
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page039">[pg 039]</span><a name="Pg039"
        id="Pg039" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> from it, to show that in the
        account of the Crucifixion there stood a passage something like the
        following:</span></p>

        <div class="block tei tei-quote" style=
        "margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is unnecessary
        here to quote the way Mr. Harris arrived at this passage, which he
        frankly states, but at once go on to compare it with our fragment. He
        sums up:</p>

        <div class="block tei tei-quote" style=
        "margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">
        <span style="font-size: 90%">Now the reader will be interested to see
        that the missing sentence which I restored to Tatian's text has
        turned up in the Gospel of Peter, for we read that:</span>
        <span class="tei tei-q"><span style=
        "font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">The Jews and
        the elders and the priests, when they saw what an evil deed they had
        done to themselves, began to beat their breasts and to say, Woe to
        our sins, for the judgment and the end of Jerusalem is at
        hand.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>
          <span style="font-size: 90%">Did the false Peter take this from
          Tatian, or was it the other way? or did both of them use some
          uncanonical writing or tradition?</span><a id="noteref_65" name=
          "noteref_65" href="#note_65"><span class=

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“There is nothing in what follows in the Arabic
        Harmony,”</span> Mr. Harris points out, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“which suggests an allusion to the desolation of the
        city, or an imprecation upon, or lamentation over,
        themselves.”</span><a id="noteref_66" name="noteref_66" href=
        "#note_66"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Very few will feel
        any doubt that this is taken from our Gospel according to Peter, or
        possibly—for of course there is no absolute proof—from the tradition
        which the writer of that Gospel also used, and not by the writer from
        the Harmony; and it may be suggested that the omission of this and
        similar passages from versions <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page040">[pg 040]</span><a name="Pg040" id="Pg040" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> of the Harmony may have been influenced by the
        fact that, not forming part of our Gospels, and not agreeing with the
        preconceived theory of a Harmony of our four Gospels, such passages
        were excluded as interpolations.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another instance
        given by Mr. Harris is the statement in the fragment: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Then the sun shone out, and it was found to be the ninth
        hour,”</span> which he compares with the language of <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Tatian's”</span> commentator: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Three hours the sun was darkened, and afterwards it

        further:</p>

        "margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">
        <span style="font-size: 90%">Another case of parallelism is in the
        speech of the angel to Mary:</span> <span class=

        he was sent.</span></em><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>
        <span style="font-size: 90%">At first sight this looks like a wilful
        expansion on the part of the writer of the Gospel; but on a reference
        to the Persian father Aphrahat, who is more than suspected of having
        used the text of Tatian, we find the words,</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style=
        "font-size: 90%">And the angels said to Mary, He is risen, and gone

        passages is found in the actual text of <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Tatian.”</span> Finally, we may quote the other instance
        pointed out by Mr. Harris:</p>

        <div class="block tei tei-quote" style=
        "margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">

        Power, hast thou forsaken me?</span><span style=
        "font-size: 90%">”</span></span> <span style="font-size: 90%">is
        peculiar in this respect, that the second possessive pronoun is
        wanting, so that we ought to translate it</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style=
        "font-size: 90%">Power, my Power ...</span><span style=
        "font-size: 90%">”</span></span> <span style="font-size: 90%">Now, it
        is curious that Tatian's text had a similar peculiarity, for Ephrem
        gives it as</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style=
        "font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">God, my
        God,</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>

          Yaiili</span></span><span style="font-size: 90%">, where the added
          suffix belongs to the possessive pronoun. This is a remarkable
          coincidence, and makes one suspect that Tatian had</span>
          <span class="tei tei-q"><span style=
          "font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Power, my

          <span style="font-size: 90%">in his text, and that it has been
          corrected away. And it is significant that Ephrem in commenting on
          the passage, says:</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style=

        reserves his final judgment on this relation between Tatian and the
        Gospel according to Peter; but as in a later article<a id=

        the fragment, it is scarcely to be decided as Peter quoting Tatian.
        Mr. Harris throughout these passages, however, states the case in a
        most impartial manner, and the reader must form his own opinion.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We may, before
        leaving <span class="tei tei-q">“Tatian,”</span> point out another
        instance of agreement to which Mr. Harris does not allude. In the
        Commentary there is the following passage: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Et dederunt ei bibere acetum et fel.</span></em>

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">71</span></span></a> It will
        be remembered that this agrees with the representation of the
        fragment that they gave Jesus <span class="tei tei-q">“vinegar and
        gall”</span> to drink.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All these
        instances may, indeed, throw a new light upon the <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Diapente</span></span>
        in the text of Victor, which has so exercised apologists, and lead to
        the opinion that Tatian's Harmony was not composed out of four
        Gospels, but out of five. If it be agreed, as it is by a majority of
        critics, that Justin made use of the Gospel of Peter, the probability
        that his pupil Tatian likewise possessed the same work, and used it
        for his Harmony, is immensely increased.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We shall not
        attempt to fix any even approximate date to the Gospel according to
        Peter, although we shall presently have to consider its relation to
        our canonical Gospels in a way which will at least assign it a
        position in time relative to them. Harnack, in the preface to the
        second edition of his article on the fragment, suspends his judgment
        on its relation to our Gospels, and will not even undertake a
        sufficient examination of this important question, so long as there
        remains a hope of still recovering more of the Gospel. It is devoutly
        to be hoped that the Cemetery of Akhmîm may still give us more of
        this and other important early works; but there is no reason why we
        should not, even now, endeavour to derive what information we can
        from this instalment, and the worst—or the best—which can happen is
        that future acquisitions may enable us to correct the errors—or
        confirm the conclusions—of the present. So long as we confine
        ourselves to the legitimate inferences to be drawn from the actual
        fragment before us, we cannot go far wrong.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is frequently
        possible to assign well-defined limits within which early works,
        whose authors are unknown, must have been composed, when a more
        precise date cannot with certainty be fixed. Direct references to the
        writing, or its use, by writers the period of whose literary work is
        known, may enable us to affirm that it was written at least before
        their time; and sometimes <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page043">[pg
        043]</span><a name="Pg043" id="Pg043" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        certain allusions or quotations in the work itself may, on the other
        hand, show that it must have been composed after a certain date; and
        thus limits, more or less narrow, become certain, within which its
        production must lie. The Gospel according to Peter, as we might
        expect, contains none of the allusions or quotations to which we
        refer, and we are therefore reduced to the one indication of
        age—reference to, or the use of it by, early writers, leaving the
        approximate date to which it may be set back wholly to conjecture. As
        we have already remarked above, the question whether it is dependent
        on, or independent of, our canonical Gospels has yet to be
        considered; but there is too much difference of opinion regarding the
        date of these Gospels themselves to render this more than a relative
        indication. So far, the opinions of critics assign the Gospel
        according to Peter to dates ranging from a period antecedent to our
        Gospels, in their present form, to about the middle of the second
        century.<a id="noteref_72" name="noteref_72" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The indications of
        style and phraseology given by the fragment have of course to be
        taken into account, and it may be well, before proceeding further, to
        examine certain peculiarities which have been pointed out by writers
        who assert that the composition is decidedly later than our canonical

        God”</span> (υἱὸς τοῦ θεοῦ). Now, with regard to these expressions,
        they are in constant use throughout the New Testament writings, in
        the Gospels themselves, as well as in the Epistles of Paul and the
        Epistles popularly ascribed to him. For instance, ὁ κύριος: Matt.

        8, 31, 34, xxii. 61, xxiv. 3, 34; John vi. 23, xi. 2, xiii. 13, 14,
        xx. 2, 13, 18, 20, 28, xxi. 7, 12. It is unnecessary to point out
        passages in the Acts and Epistles, for <span class="tei tei-q">“the
        Lord,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“the Lord Jesus,”</span> or
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the Lord Jesus Christ,”</span> is everywhere
        used, and indeed no other form, it may be said, is adopted.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“A Son of God”</span> (υἱὸς τοῦ θεοῦ) is
        constantly used in the Gospels and Acts. A few instances may be
        given: Matt. viii. 29, xiv. 33, xvi. 16, xxvi. 63, xxvii. 40, 43, 54;
        Mark i. 1, iii. 11, v. 7, xv. 39; Luke i. 35, ix. 41, viii. 28, xxii.
        70; John i. 34, 49, v. 25, x. 36, xi. 4, 27, xix. 7, xx. 31; Acts ix.
        20. Of course, in the Epistles the expression is of frequent
        occurrence, as for instance, Rom. i. 4, 9, v. 10; 1 Cor. i. 9; 2 Cor.
        i. 19; Gal. ii. 20, and elsewhere. It is not necessary to show that
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Saviour”</span> is used, but the following
        may be pointed out: Luke ii. 11; John iv. 42; Acts v. 31, xiii. 23;
        and it more frequently occurs in the Epistles. All of these
        expressions are commonly employed in early Christian literature, such
        as the <span class="tei tei-q">“Didache,”</span> Ignatian Epistles,
        Clement of Rome, Polycarp, <span class="tei tei-q">“Pastor”</span> of
        Hermas, and the <span class="tei tei-q">“Apology”</span> of
        Aristides.</p>

        from this fragment, a later date than our canonical works, is the use

        Eastern Greek-speaking Christians from the end of the first century.
        But Peter not only uses it freely, but seems to be unconscious that
        he is guilty of an anachronism when he imports this exclusively
        Christian term into the Gospel history. Ἡ κυριακή has so completely
        supplanted Ἡ μία τῶν σαββάτων, that it is twice used to describe the
        first Easter Day, in a document which usually manifests precision in
        such matters.</span><a id="noteref_77" name="noteref_77" href=

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is not quite
        clear what Dr. Swete means when he says that Peter <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“uses it freely,”</span> but it would indeed be singular
        if he seemed to be conscious that he was guilty of an anachronism in
        making use of this or any word. The question, in fact, is whether it
        is an anachronism or not, and that it is so is very far from proved
        by any arguments yet brought forward. In the Apocalypse, i. 10, we
        have the use of the term <span class="tei tei-q">“the Lord's
        day”</span> (ἡ κυριακὴ ἡμέρα), <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 68-69. In the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Didache,”</span> which Dr. Lightfoot assigns
        to the first or the beginning of the second century, we meet with
        κυριακὴ κυρίου; and in the Ignatian Epistles, which those who believe
        in them date <span class="tei tei-q">“in the early years of the
        second century,”</span> there is in one place<a id="noteref_78" name=

        κυριακήν. So far from its being surprising that there should not be
        more authority for such an expression, however, it seems almost more
        remarkable that we should have any parallels at all, when we remember
        how few early writings are extant, and how few of these actually
        refer to the day thus designated. The Epistles, for this reason, may
        be set aside in a body, for they give no testimony either way,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page046">[pg 046]</span><a name="Pg046"
        id="Pg046" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> with the exception of 1 Cor.
        xvi. 2, where <span class="tei tei-q">“the first day of the
        week”</span> is referred to. The three Synoptics, following each
        other, and a common tradition, use ἡ μία τῶν σαββάτων each once, and
        the fourth Gospel has the same phrase twice, and the Acts once; but
        this use of another expression does not—in the face of the use of ἡ
        κυριακή in this fragment, and of ἡ κυριακὴ ἡμέρα, in the
        Apocalypse—at all show that, at the same period, the latter phrase
        was not also current, though it may not have supplanted <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the first day of the week.”</span> The fact that Melito
        of Sardis, <span class="tei tei-q">“about the middle of the second
        century,”</span> wrote a treatise περὶ κυριακῆς shows how general
        that expression had become; and even Dr. Swete, as we have seen
        above, recognises that it was <span class="tei tei-q">“familiar
        amongst Eastern Greek-speaking Christians from the end of the first
        century.”</span> There is nothing whatever to warrant the conclusion
        that its use at the time when our Gospels were written would have
        been an anachronism, but the fact that a different expression
        happened to be used in a few writings. The author of the fragment
        employs the phrase twice only, and it is thoroughly consistent with
        his impressive style throughout the episode, that he should apply to
        the time when these astounding events are said to have taken place
        the appropriate term, already suggested by the author of the
        Apocalypse, of <span class="tei tei-q">“the Lord's day,”</span>
        instead of <span class="tei tei-q">“the first day of the
        week.”</span> There is nothing more difficult, as is proved every day
        in our time, than to fix the precise date at which words or
        expressions first came into use, and especially—in the absence of
        voluminous literature opposing the presumption—the denial of
        antiquity to a work, on the ground of its employing an expression
        supposed only to have come into general use a few years later than
        its otherwise probable date, is both rash and unjustifiable.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We now come to the
        most important part of our examination of this fragment, whether in
        regard to its approximate date or to its intrinsic value as an early
        Christian document—its relation to our canonical Gospels. The
        fragment begins and ends with a broken sentence, but taking it as it
        stands, in comparison with the same episodes in our four canonical
        Gospels, it contains about a fourth more matter. It will be seen that
        it is very far from a Harmony of the four narratives, and still less
        an abridgment of their common tradition, but it has markedly the
        character of an independent history drawn from similar, but varying,
        sources.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The fragment
        commences, <span class="tei tei-q">“but of the Jews no man washed his
        hands, neither Herod nor any of his judges; and as they were not
        minded to wash, Pilate rose.<a id="noteref_79" name="noteref_79"
        href="#note_79"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">79</span></span></a> (2) And
        then Herod the King commandeth the Lord to be taken, saying unto
        them: <span class="tei tei-q">‘Whatsoever I commanded that ye should
        do, that do unto him.’</span> ”</span> It is clear from this that the
        tribunal before which it is represented that Jesus was taken for
        trial was quite different from that described in the canonical
        Gospels. Herod and other Jewish judges must, according to the writer,
        have sat along with Pilate, but the order given by <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Herod the King”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“to take
        the Lord”</span> evidently shows that he is represented as playing
        the leading <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page048">[pg
        048]</span><a name="Pg048" id="Pg048" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        part. Although the episode of the washing of the hands (of which so
        much more is made by the author of the first Synoptic, who alone of
        the canonical Evangelists refers to it) must have been introduced, we
        have no means of knowing how far the two accounts may have agreed.
        Both, at least in one shape or another, adopt a tradition so
        incredible as that representing a Roman governor coerced into
        condemning an innocent man, and helplessly going through such a
        ceremony for the purpose of clearing himself from responsibility for
        gross injustice. The third Synoptist is the only one of the canonical
        Evangelists who prominently brings forward the share of Herod in
        judging Jesus (xxiii. 6-15), and he is in curious agreement with the
        spirit of Peter's account when he represents Pilate (xxiii. 6-7), on
        hearing that Jesus was a Galilean, recognising <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“that he was of Herod's jurisdiction,”</span> and sending
        him to Herod, <span class="tei tei-q">“who himself also was at
        Jerusalem in these days.”</span> The statement also (xxiii. 12) that
        Herod and Pilate, having before been at enmity, became friends that
        day through this very act recognising Herod's jurisdiction, seems to
        point to a tradition coupling Herod with the trial, a form of which
        we have in the fragment. All the other Gospels are not only silent
        upon the point, but exclude his participation in the matter. When,
        according to our fragment, <span class="tei tei-q">“Pilate
        rose,”</span> he seems to have passed out of all connection with the
        trial and condemnation of Jesus.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At this point,
        Peter represents the request for the body of Jesus as having been
        made but, before considering this part of his narrative, we must note
        the portions of the canonical account which he altogether omits. The
        first of these to which we must refer is the preference of Barabbas,
        which all of our four Evangelists carefully relate. Considering that
        his main object in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page049">[pg
        049]</span><a name="Pg049" id="Pg049" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        writing this Gospel, according to some critics, was animosity to the
        Jews and a desire to cast upon them the whole guilt and
        responsibility of the death of Jesus, it is very remarkable that he
        should altogether exclude this picturesque episode, and sacrifice so
        favourable an opportunity of throwing upon them the odium of crying
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Not this man, but Barabbas.”</span> There is
        strong presumptive evidence here of his entire independence of our
        four Gospels, for it is not reasonable to suppose that, if he had
        them before him, he could deliberately have passed over such striking
        material. A further indication of the same kind is to be found in the
        fact that he apparently knows nothing of the appeals made by Pilate
        to the people in favour of Jesus, so furiously rejected by them. It
        is distinctly a merit in the narrative of Peter that he does not,
        like the four Evangelists, give us the very extraordinary spectacle
        of a Roman Governor and Judge feebly expostulating with a noisy
        Jewish mob in favour of an accused person brought for trial before
        him, whom he repeatedly declares to be innocent, and at last allowing
        himself to be coerced against his will into scourging and crucifying
        him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to the
        four canonical Gospels,<a id="noteref_80" name="noteref_80" href=
        "#note_80"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">80</span></span></a> the
        request of Joseph for the body of Jesus is made after he has expired
        on the cross. In Matthew (xxvii. 57 f.) he is a rich man from
        Arimathaea named Joseph, who also himself was a disciple of Jesus,
        and he goes to Pilate and asks for the body, which Pilate commands to
        be given to him. In Mark (xv. 43) Joseph of Arimathaea, a councillor
        of honourable estate, who also himself was looking for the kingdom of
        God, boldly goes in unto Pilate and asks for the body of Jesus.
        According to Matthew it is <span class="tei tei-q">“When even was
        come”</span> that he goes to <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page050">[pg 050]</span><a name="Pg050" id="Pg050" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> Pilate; in Mark it is <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“When even was now come, because it was the Preparation,
        that is, the day before the Sabbath.”</span> In Matthew, Pilate
        simply commands that the body should be given; but in Mark it is
        further related (xv. 44): <span class="tei tei-q">“And Pilate
        marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto him the
        centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead. And when
        he learned it of the centurion he granted the corpse to
        Joseph.”</span> In Luke (xxiii. 50 f.): <span class="tei tei-q">“A
        man named Joseph, who was a councillor, a good man and a righteous
        (he had not consented to their counsel and deed), of Arimathaea, a
        city of the Jews, who was looking for the kingdom of God: this man
        went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.”</span> It is
        implied, but not said, that it was granted, and the time is mentioned
        further on (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">v.</span></span> 54): <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And it was the day of the Preparation, and the Sabbath
        drew on,”</span>—which recalls Mark. In John (xix. 38): <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“After these things [the <span lang="la" class=
        "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">crurifragium</span></span> and piercing of the
        side], Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly
        for fear of the Jews, asked of Pilate that he might take away the
        body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave.”</span> In Peter, the
        request is made before Jesus is actually sent to be crucified, and
        the author is sometimes accused of perverting the narrative by
        introducing it at this time. It is impossible to see any object for
        so altering the sequence of events as given by the four canonical
        Gospels, on the supposition that he knew them, and it will be seen
        that the time in Peter's narrative is in perfect accord with the
        version which he gives of the trial. <span class="tei tei-q">“Pilate
        rose,”</span> and it is to be inferred that he left the Praetorium.
        It is at this moment that Joseph seizes the opportunity of asking for
        the body: 3. <span class="tei tei-q">“But there was there Joseph the
        friend of Pilate<a id="noteref_81" name="noteref_81" href=
        "#note_81"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">81</span></span></a> and of
        the Lord, and knowing that they <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page051">[pg 051]</span><a name="Pg051" id="Pg051" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> are about to crucify (σταυρίσκειν) him, he came
        to Pilate and asked the body of the Lord for burial. 4. And Pilate
        sent to Herod and asked for his body; 5. and Herod said: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘Brother Pilate, even if no one had begged for him, we
        should have buried him, because the Sabbath is at hand, for it is
        written in the Law: The sun must not go down upon one put to
        death.’</span> ”</span> It is to be noted that, whilst in the four
        canonical Gospels the request for the body is immediately followed by
        the entombment, in our fragment the request is made in anticipation,
        when a favourable moment for the request presented itself, and the
        actual reception of the body follows later, in its proper place. It
        is possible that the statement, in Luke (xxiii. 50-51), that Joseph
        was <span class="tei tei-q">“a councillor”</span> who had
        <span class="tei tei-q">“not consented to their counsel and
        deed,”</span> which is here alone referred to, may indicate another
        tradition, of part of which Peter may have availed himself, and that
        it included his presence at the trial and consequently presented the
        opportunity of at once going to Pilate. That Pilate should send on
        the request to Herod is only in keeping with the representation that
        he had withdrawn from the trial, and would not himself further
        interfere in the matter. The mode of carrying on his narrative, by
        direct utterances put into the mouths of his personages, is
        particularly characteristic of the writer, and forms a remarkable
        feature of his style throughout. There is no sign of dependence upon
        the canonical Gospels in all this: but, on the contrary, the almost
        complete departure from their representations, in order and in
        substance, is only explicable on the hypothesis of a separate, though
        analogous, tradition.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If we look at the
        language, we find that critics point out one phrase which is common
        to the three Synoptics: <span class="tei tei-q">“He went in unto
        Pilate [and] asked for the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page052">[pg
        052]</span><a name="Pg052" id="Pg052" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        body of Jesus”</span> (προσελθὼν τῷ Πειλάτῳ ᾐτήσατο τὸ σῶμα τοῦ
        Ἰησοῦ,<a id="noteref_82" name="noteref_82" href=
        "#note_82"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        and Luke; εἰσῆλθεν πρὸς τὸν Πειλᾶτον καὶ ᾐτήσατο τὸ σῶμα τοῦ Ἰησοῦ,
        Mark). In Peter we have: <span class="tei tei-q">“He came to Pilate
        and asked for the body of the Lord”</span> (ἦλθεν πρὸς τὸν Πειλᾶτον
        καὶ ᾔτησε τὸ σῶμα τοῦ κυρίου). It will be observed that the language
        of the three Synoptists is almost exactly the same, and although
        their interdependence throughout requires another explanation, which
        need not be entered into here, it is quite unreasonable to infer
        dependence on the part of Peter from similarity in these few words.
        It is the description of a perfectly simple action, in the most
        simple and natural language, and it is difficult to imagine what
        other words could be used without inflation. All the rest of the
        episode differs in every respect of language, order and substantial
        detail. It is right to add, however, that no great weight is attached
        by anyone to the point. On the other hand, it may be pointed out that
        σταυρίσκειν, in Peter, is a most uncommon word, not used in the New
        Testament at all, and that ταφή only occurs once in the New
        Testament, in Matt. xxvii. 7.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before proceeding
        to compare this passage with our Gospels, it may be well to determine
        who the mockers in this fragment really are. It is argued by
        Zahn<a id="noteref_83" name="noteref_83" href="#note_83"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">83</span></span></a> and
        others, that Herod, according to this representation, hands Jesus
        over to the Jews, and that the people, and not the soldiers, as in
        the Gospels, conduct the mockery which is here described. It cannot
        be denied that the words used are, <span class="tei tei-q">“he
        delivered him to the people”</span> (παρέδωκεν αὐτὸν τῷ λαῷ), but the
        question is, whether the meaning is that he actually delivered him
        into the hands of the mob, and that the subsequent mockery,
        scourging, crucifixion and parting of the garments were performed by
        the people, or that, in delivering Jesus to the people, the meaning
        is not rather that he gave him up to their demands that he should be
        crucified, and that all the rest followed between soldiers and
        people, as in the other narratives. We cannot but affirm that this
        latter interpretation is the true one. In Luke (xxiii. 25) the form
        of words used exactly expresses this: <span class="tei tei-q">“but
        Jesus he delivered up to their will”</span> (τὸν δὲ Ἰησοῦν παρέδωκεν
        τῷ θελήματι αὐτῶν). But a still more close representation of the case
        occurs in the fourth Gospel, where we read (xix. 16 f.): <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Then, therefore, he delivered him unto them [the people
        and the chief priests] to be crucified. They took Jesus, therefore
        ... unto the place called, &amp;c. ... where they crucified
        him.”</span> It is only in verse 23 that the narrative goes back and
        explains: <span class="tei tei-q">“The soldiers, therefore, when they
        had crucified Jesus,”</span> &amp;c. In the fragment, moreover, there
        is an important indication in the portion previously quoted, where we
        read: 2. <span class="tei tei-q">“And then Herod the King commandeth
        the Lord to be taken, saying unto them: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘Whatsoever I commanded that ye should do, that do unto
        him.’</span> ”</span> Who are indicated by <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page054">[pg 054]</span><a name="Pg054" id="Pg054" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> the pronoun <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“them”</span>?<a id="noteref_84" name="noteref_84" href=
        "#note_84"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        Doubtless the context would have explained this and probably made
        clear all that follows, for the orders given must have been regarding
        the crucifixion, since in the following verse (3) it is said that
        Joseph, <span class="tei tei-q">“knowing that they are about to
        crucify him,”</span> came to Pilate. Nothing had previously been
        said, in this fragment, of crucifixion. It is not possible to admit
        that the writer intends to represent that the people themselves
        carried out the crucifixion, or that the orders given by Herod were
        to the crowd. Herod, in all probability, is represented as commanding
        his own soldiers, which would accord with the statement in the third
        Synoptic (xxiii. 11), that Herod <span class="tei tei-q">“with his
        soldiers set him at nought and mocked him,”</span> and so on. The
        doubt only proceeds from indefinite statement on the part of the
        writer, and preconceived ideas on the part of critics.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is evident,
        from the statement that Jesus was delivered for crucifixion
        <span class="tei tei-q">“before the first day of the Unleavened bread
        of their feast,”</span> that the Gospel of Peter adopts the same
        chronology as the fourth Gospel, in contradiction to that of the
        three Synoptics, and represents Jesus as put to death on the 14th
        Nisan. His agreement with the fourth Gospel, however, is limited to
        the mere matter of date, for on all other points the author takes a
        widely different view. As Hilgenfeld points out, for him all the
        feasts prescribed by the Law are mere Jewish institutions, and he has
        none of the Johannine (xix. 33 f.) views as to the death of Jesus
        representing the Paschal offering, nor does he <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page055">[pg 055]</span><a name="Pg055" id="Pg055"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> associate with that the circumstances
        regarding the breaking of the limbs, and the thrust of the spear in
        his side, which he altogether omits.<a id="noteref_85" name=
        "noteref_85" href="#note_85"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">85</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The author of the
        fragment is reproached with the looseness of his narrative of the
        mockery, on the supposition that he represents the clothing in purple
        and the setting on the seat of judgment as occurring whilst Jesus is
        being dragged along by the Jews; but this is not the case. The
        hurrying along commences the mockery in verse 6. Then in verse 7
        begins another episode. They clothe Jesus in purple and set him on
        the judgment seat. Now, before going into the details of this
        mockery, it is necessary to consider how the narrative in general
        accords with the account in the four canonical Gospels. In Peter, the
        whole of the mockery is represented as taking place after Jesus is
        delivered to be crucified. He is hustled along, clothed in purple and
        set upon a seat of judgment; the crown of thorns is put upon his
        head, they spit in his eyes and smite him on the cheeks, pierce him
        with a reed and scourge him. In the Synoptics, especially, the
        ill-usage is as much as possible lengthened and intensified. In
        Matthew, the mockery begins when Jesus is in the house of Caiaphas
        (xxvi. 67 f.): <span class="tei tei-q">“Then did they spit in his
        face and buffet him; and some smote him with the palms of their
        hands, saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ: who is he that struck
        thee?”</span> After Pilate causes Jesus to be scourged, and delivers
        him, the mockery begins afresh (xxvii. 27 ff.): <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the
        Palace and gathered unto him the whole band. And they stripped him,
        and put on him a scarlet robe. And they plaited a crown of thorns and
        put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand; and they kneeled
        down before him and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page056">[pg
        056]</span><a name="Pg056" id="Pg056" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews! And they spat upon him
        and took the reed and smote him on the head. And when they had mocked
        him they took off from him the robe and put on him his garments, and
        led him away to crucify him.”</span> In Mark, the mockery also begins
        in the house of the high priest (xiv. 65 ff.): <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face and
        to buffet him, and to say unto him: Prophesy: and the officers
        received him with blows of their hands.”</span> The mockery
        recommences after Jesus is scourged and delivered over to be
        crucified (xv. 16 ff.): <span class="tei tei-q">“And the soldiers led
        him away within the court, which is the Praetorium; and they call
        together the whole band. And they clothe him with purple, and
        plaiting a crown of thorns, they put it on him; and they begin to
        salute him, Hail, King of the Jews! And they smote his head with a
        reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing their knees, worshipped him.
        And when they had mocked him, they took off from him the purple, and
        put on him his garments, and they led him out to crucify him.”</span>
        Of course it is unnecessary to point out how these two accounts
        depend upon each other. The same representation is made in the third
        Synoptic (xxii. 66 ff.): <span class="tei tei-q">“And the men that
        held him mocked him and beat him. And they blindfolded him, and asked
        him, saying, Prophesy: who is he that struck thee? And many other
        things spake they against him, reviling him.”</span> This passes, as
        in the other Synoptics, in the house of the high priest, but the
        subsequent mocking does not take place after Pilate delivers Jesus to
        be crucified, but after he has been examined by Herod (xxiii. 11):
        <span class="tei tei-q">“And Herod with his soldiers set him at
        nought, and mocked him, and arraying him in gorgeous apparel sent him
        back to Pilate.”</span> In the fourth Gospel there is only the one
        scene of mockery, and that is placed where Jesus <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page057">[pg 057]</span><a name="Pg057" id="Pg057"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> is scourged by the order of Pilate (xix.
        2): <span class="tei tei-q">“And the soldiers plaited a crown of
        thorns and put it on his head, and arrayed him in a purple garment;
        and they came unto him, and said: Hail, King of the Jews! and they
        struck him with their hands.”</span> In many respects this is the
        most incredible of the four narratives, for the scene is reported as
        taking place in the presence of Pilate and before his final
        condemnation of Jesus; and in the very next verse (4) it is said:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“And Pilate went out again, and saith unto
        them, Behold, I bring him out to you, that ye may know that I find no
        crime in him. Jesus therefore came out, wearing the crown of thorns
        and the purple garment. And Pilate saith unto them; Behold the
        man!”</span> Although this scene, which has been the delight of
        artists ever since, is so picturesque, it is quite evident that it is
        opposed to all that we have in the Synoptics, as well as in our
        fragment, and that the representation of Pilate allowing his soldiers
        in his presence to act in such a way, not to speak of the scourging,
        to a man accused before him, of whom he so strongly declares,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I find no crime in him,”</span> is quite
        inadmissible. The narrative in Peter is at variance with all these
        accounts, whilst reproducing a similar tradition, and not varying
        more from our Gospels than they do from each other. The variation,
        however, is not that of a writer compiling a narrative from the
        canonical Gospels, but the distinct representation of one
        independently making use of similar, but separate, materials.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have already
        discussed, in connection with Justin's reference, the passage of
        Peter in which it is said that <span class="tei tei-q">“they clad him
        with purple and set him on a seat of judgment, saying: Judge justly,
        King of Israel.”</span> Of course it is argued by some that this is
        derived from the fourth Gospel, on the strength of the words just
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page058">[pg 058]</span><a name="Pg058"
        id="Pg058" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> quoted: ἐκάθισαν αὐτὸν ἐπὶ
        καθέδραν κρίσεως, which are compared with the ἐκάθισεν ἐπὶ βήματος of
        the fourth Gospel. It is said that Archbishop Whately used to render
        these words <span class="tei tei-q">“and set him on the judgment
        seat,”</span> understanding the verb καθίζειν to be used
        transitively, and thus stating that Pilate actually set Jesus in
        mockery upon a judgment seat. It is suggested that both Justin, as we
        have seen, and Peter may have misunderstood the passage, and based
        their statement upon it. Now, although it must be admitted that the
        Greek may be rendered in this way, yet it would be necessary to add
        αὐτὸν to justify such use of the verb. In connection with this
        argument they cite the words of Isaiah lviii. 2, in the Septuagint
        version, referred to by Justin: <span class="tei tei-q">“For as the
        prophet said, they dragged him, and set him on the judgment seat, and
        said: Judge for us!”</span> The Septuagint has: αἰτεῖτέ με νῦν κρίσιν
        δικαίαν ... λέγοντες. It is asserted that the idea of setting Jesus
        on the judgment seat came from the passage of the fourth Gospel which
        is quoted above, understood transitively. The representation that
        Pilate actually set Jesus on the judgment seat, if linguistically
        defensible, is rejected by most critics and, as has already been
        mentioned, amongst others by the Revisers of the New Testament. The
        words used for <span class="tei tei-q">“seat of judgment”</span> in
        the fragment, ἐπὶ καθέδραν κρίσεως, differ entirely from the ἐπὶ
        βήματος of the fourth Gospel. The analogous <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Prophesy unto us, thou Christ: who is he that struck
        thee?”</span> and the <span class="tei tei-q">“Hail, King of the
        Jews,”</span> are, of course, widely different from the
        representation in Peter, in which the <span class="tei tei-q">“Judge
        justly!”</span> is evidently in mockery of the Messianic claims of
        Jesus, and the <span class="tei tei-q">“King of Israel”</span> a
        peculiarity of this Gospel to which we shall have to refer again
        further on. The statement that <span class="tei tei-q">“others
        pierced him with a reed”</span> is also a variation <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page059">[pg 059]</span><a name="Pg059" id="Pg059"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> from the canonical Gospels, which only
        say, <span class="tei tei-q">“they took the reed and smote him on the
        head.”</span> The fourth Gospel has alone the representation of the
        soldier piercing the side of Jesus with a spear <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“that the Scripture might be fulfilled.... They shall
        look on him whom they pierced,”</span> but in our fragment the
        representation is made casually and without any appearance of
        dogmatic intention. The crown of thorns is used merely incidentally,
        as in the case of the Synoptics, and without the artistic prominence
        given to it in the fourth Gospel.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is no
        mention in Peter of any one bearing the cross, and in this there is a
        departure from the narrative both of the Synoptics and of the fourth
        Gospel. The Synoptics have in common, as usual, the story regarding
        its being laid on the shoulders of Simon of Cyrene (Matt. xxvii. 32
        f., Mark xv. 21 f., Luke xxiii. 26 f.), whom they compelled to carry
        it to Calvary. The fourth Gospel not only omits this episode, but
        contradicts it in good set terms (xix. 17): <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“They took Jesus, therefore; and he went out, bearing the
        cross for himself, unto the place called <span class="tei tei-q">‘The
        place of a skull.’</span> ”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Peter does not
        enter into any intermediate detail, but at once says: 10.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“And they brought two malefactors and
        crucified between them the Lord; but he kept silence, as feeling no
        pain.”</span> The canonical Gospels all narrate the crucifixion of
        the two malefactors, but the various terms in which this is done must
        be given for comparison. Matthew says (xxvii. 38): <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Then are there crucified with him two robbers, one on
        the right hand, and one on the left.”</span> Mark uses almost the
        same words (xv. 27). Luke, with some exercise of his usual
        constructive style, says the same thing (xxiii. 32 f.): <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And there were also two others, malefactors, led with
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page060">[pg 060]</span><a name="Pg060"
        id="Pg060" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> him to be put to death. And
        when they came unto the place which is called <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘The skull,’</span> there they crucified him and the
        malefactors, one on the right hand and the other on the left.”</span>
        The fourth Gospel reads (xix. 17 f.): <span class="tei tei-q">“They
        took Jesus therefore; and he went out, bearing the cross for himself,
        unto the place called <span class="tei tei-q">‘The place of a
        skull,’</span> which is called in Hebrew Golgotha: where they
        crucified him, and with him two others, on either side one, and Jesus
        in the midst.”</span> The only remark necessary here is that in Peter
        the common tradition is given with independence and simplicity.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is only in the
        last words of the verse that we have an important variation.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“But he kept silence, as feeling no
        pain.”</span> We have already referred to this as one of the
        recognised Docetic passages of the fragment, although there is no
        necessity to read it in this sense. Mr. Murray has pointed out a
        passage in Origen in which that writer <span class="tei tei-q">“gives
        them an innocent”</span> (that is, not a Docetic) <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“interpretation.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Although there is
        no exact parallel to this in our Gospels, it is worth a moment's
        notice that the silence of Jesus during the trial is mentioned as
        remarkable and as exciting wonder. We have not in our fragment,
        unfortunately, the earlier part of the trial, and cannot, therefore,
        see whether the words used have any reference to previous
        representations. In Matt. xxvii. 12 f., it is said: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And when he was accused by the chief priests and elders,
        he answered nothing. Then saith <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page061">[pg 061]</span><a name="Pg061" id="Pg061" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many
        things they witness against thee? And he gave him no answer, not even
        to one word: insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.”</span> An
        almost identical account is given in Mark. In Luke it is to the
        questioning of Herod that Jesus is silent (xxiii. 9): <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And he [Herod] questioned him in many words; but he
        answered him nothing.”</span> In the fourth Gospel not only is
        nothing said of the silence of Jesus, but he is represented as
        answering freely—and in the tone of the discourses which characterise
        that Gospel—the questions of Pilate. Now, in the Synoptics, we have a
        silence described, which causes the governor to marvel greatly, that
        is not, however, when we go into detail, very marked in them, and is
        excluded by the fourth Gospel. Can a silence have been referred to,
        in the original tradition, which was connected with the trial,
        instead of the cross, because it began to receive a Docetic
        application, but which we have, in its earlier form, in Peter?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In our fragment,
        the narrative continues: 11. <span class="tei tei-q">“And as they set
        up the cross they wrote thereon: <span class="tei tei-q">‘This is the
        King of Israel.’</span> ”</span> We have here a continuation of the
        indefinite <span class="tei tei-q">“they,”</span> which it becomes at
        every step more impossible to identify otherwise than with the
        soldiers. It is a most curious circumstance, frequently pointed out,
        that no two of the Gospels agree even in so plain a matter as should
        be the inscription on the cross, and that the Gospel of Peter differs
        from them all. Matthew gives it (xxvii. 37): <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“This is Jesus, the King of the Jews;”</span> Mark (xv.
        26): <span class="tei tei-q">“The King of the Jews;”</span> Luke
        (xxiii. 38): <span class="tei tei-q">“This is the King of the
        Jews,”</span> and John (xix. 19): <span class="tei tei-q">“Jesus of
        Nazareth, the King of the Jews.”</span> The author of the fourth
        Gospel adds the statement that this title <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“was written in Hebrew, in <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page062">[pg 062]</span><a name="Pg062" id="Pg062" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> Latin, and in Greek,”</span> and further gives
        a conversation between the <span class="tei tei-q">“chief priests of
        the Jews”</span> and Pilate, in which they complain of this
        superscription, and wish it to be put <span class="tei tei-q">“that
        he said, I am King of the Jews,”</span> to which Pilate answered
        briefly, <span class="tei tei-q">“What I have written, I have
        written.”</span> With so many forms to select from, is it reasonable
        to suppose that Peter would have invented another superscription, if
        these four Gospels had actually been before him?<a id="noteref_87"
        name="noteref_87" href="#note_87"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">87</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The author of the
        fragment continues: 12. <span class="tei tei-q">“And they laid the
        clothes before him and distributed them and cast lots (λαχμὸν ἔβαλον)
        for them.”</span> In Matthew (xxvii. 35) it is said: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And when they had crucified him, they parted his
        garments among them, casting lots”</span> (βάλλοντες κλῆρον); in Mark
        (xv. 24): <span class="tei tei-q">“And they crucify him, and part his
        garments among them, casting lots (βάλλοντες κλῆρον) upon them, what
        each should take.”</span> In Luke there is a similar statement
        (xxiii. 34): <span class="tei tei-q">“And parting his garments among
        them, they cast lots”</span> (ἔβαλον κλῆρον). In the fourth Gospel,
        as usual, we have further details (xix. 23 f.): <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The soldiers therefore, when they had crucified Jesus,
        took his garments and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and
        also the coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top
        throughout. They said therefore one to another, Let us not rend it,
        but cast lots (λάχωμεν) for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture
        might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my garments among them,
        and upon my vesture did they cast lots”</span> (ἔβαλον κλῆρον). In
        discussing the connection of Justin with the Gospel of Peter, we have
        already partly dealt with this passage, and now confront it with all
        the four <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page063">[pg
        063]</span><a name="Pg063" id="Pg063" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        Gospels. It is obvious that the language of the three Synoptics is
        distinct from that of Peter, who uses the unusual word λαχμός, not
        found in any of the Gospels. The fourth Gospel has the common verb
        λαγχάνω, whilst the quotation from the Psalm (xxii. 18), from which
        the whole episode emanates, uses the expression common to the three
        Synoptics, ἔβαλον κλῆρον. There is no reason for supposing that Peter
        makes use of our Gospels here, and in the absence of other evidence,
        the λαχμός is decisive proof of his independence.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The author of our
        fragment, after the crucifixion, has none of the mocking speeches of
        the four Gospels, and he ignores the episode of the penitent thief,
        as it is told in the third Synoptic, but he relates, instead, how one
        of the malefactors rebuked the mockers: 13. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“But one of these malefactors reproved them, saying: We
        have suffered this for the evil which we wrought, but this man who
        has become the saviour of men, what wrong hath he done you? 14. And
        they were angry with him, and they commanded that his legs should not
        be broken, in order that he might die in torment.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It will be
        remembered that the episode of the penitent thief is given in Luke
        only, and that the other Gospels do not mention any utterance of the
        two malefactors said to have been crucified with Jesus. Luke's
        narrative reads (xxiii. 39 f.): <span class="tei tei-q">“And one of
        the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying: Art not thou
        the Christ? Save thyself and us. But the other answered, and rebuking
        him said, Dost thou not even fear God, seeing thou art in the same
        condemnation? And we indeed justly: for we receive the due reward of
        our deeds; but this man hath done nothing amiss. And he said, Jesus,
        remember me when thou comest in thy kingdom. And he said unto him,
        Verily, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page064">[pg 064]</span><a name=
        "Pg064" id="Pg064" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> I say unto thee,
        To-day shalt thou be with me in Paradise.”</span> That all the other
        Gospels should have excluded an incident like this, supposing it to
        have really occurred, is very extraordinary, and the only conclusion
        to which we can come is either that it did not occur, or that they
        were ignorant of it. Peter has evidently got an earlier form of the
        story, without those much later touches with which the third
        Synoptist has embellished it. The malefactor rebukes the Jews and not
        his fellow, and if he display a piety which is not very natural under
        the circumstances, he is not in this more remarkable than his
        counterpart in the third Synoptic. That the author was not acquainted
        with the form in Luke, and is quite uninfluenced by it, seems to us
        manifest.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is rendered
        all the more apparent by the continuation in Peter, in which, instead
        of any reply from Jesus, or any promise of Paradise, there is
        connected with the rebuke of the malefactor on the cross a view of
        the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
        "la"><span style="font-style: italic">crurifragium</span></span>
        which is quite foreign to the canonical Gospels. When the malefactor
        had spoken, instead of their being mollified, the fragment declares:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“And they were angry with him, and they
        commanded that his legs should not be broken, in order that he might
        die in torment.”</span> Now, here, there is a point which demands
        examination. To whom does this sentence refer? to Jesus or the
        malefactor? It is at first sight, and apart from consideration of the
        style of the writer, a reference to the latter, but on closer
        examination it seems to us more probable that the writer intended it
        to apply to Jesus. In any case, it is a point in which so remarkable
        a version of the story is concerned that it cannot but be considered
        as very singular that most apologetic critics have passed it over
        without any notice whatever, and apparently treated the order not to
        break the legs as applying to <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page065">[pg 065]</span><a name="Pg065" id="Pg065" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> the malefactor and not to Jesus.<a id=

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">88</span></span></a> In the
        first edition of his article on the fragment, Harnack took the view
        that more probably the malefactor was indicated here, but in his
        second edition he withdraws this, and adopts the conclusion that the
        reference of αὐτῷ to Jesus <span class="tei tei-q">“appears more
        acceptable, both on account of John xix. 32 f., and also on account
        of the context.”</span><a id="noteref_89" name="noteref_89" href=
        "#note_89"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">89</span></span></a> Zahn
        considers the whole episode in Peter as a caricature of the Gospel
        tradition, through the author's hatred of the Jews, and refers only
        indirectly to the version of the <span lang="la" class=
        "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">crurifragium</span></span> as drawn by the
        caricaturist from the <span class="tei tei-q">“Motive”</span> of the
        fourth Evangelist, but does not further go into the matter than to
        say, with mysterious reticence: <span class="tei tei-q">“Whoever is
        of another opinion should keep it to himself”</span>!<a id=
        "noteref_90" name="noteref_90" href="#note_90"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">90</span></span></a>
        Hilgenfeld, who considers the whole passage as quite independent of
        our Gospels, regrets Harnack's change of view, and applies the αὐτῷ
        to the malefactor;<a id="noteref_91" name="noteref_91" href=
        "#note_91"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">91</span></span></a> but many
        able critics, with equal decision, understand it as a reference to
        Jesus,<a id="noteref_92" name="noteref_92" href=
        "#note_92"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">92</span></span></a> and
        Harnack himself, of course, sees that, even adopting his later view,
        there is a clear contradiction in the account in Peter to the
        representation of the fourth Gospel. To independent criticism, the
        result is a matter of indifference, and we shall merely state the
        reasons which seem to favour the view that the passage was intended
        to apply to Jesus, and then present the consequence if it be referred
        to the malefactor.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Throughout the
        whole of the fragment, the sustained purpose of the author is to
        present Jesus in the strongest <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page066">[pg 066]</span><a name="Pg066" id="Pg066" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> light, and subordinate everything to the
        representation of his sufferings and resurrection. At the part we are
        considering, the narrative is of the closest and most condensed
        character: the crucifixion between the two malefactors; the silence
        as feeling no pain; the superscription on the cross, and the parting
        of the garments, are all told without wasting a word. The reproach of
        the malefactor, apparently addressed to those who are parting the
        garments, is more intended to increase our sympathy for Jesus than to
        excite it for the speaker, and it is certainly not the writer's
        purpose to divert our attention from the sufferings of Jesus by
        presenting those of the generous malefactor. Rather it is to show
        that the more the high character and mission of Jesus are set forth,
        the more bitter becomes the animosity and hatred of the Jews; so
        that, to the remonstrance of the malefactor, they reply by increasing
        the sufferings of Jesus. In short, the sense of the passage seems to
        be <span class="tei tei-q">“And they, being angered at what was said,
        commanded that the legs of Jesus should not be broken, that he might
        die in torment.”</span> However, let us take the view that the
        command was given that the malefactor's legs should not be broken,
        that he might die in torment. It clearly follows that, if he was to
        be made to suffer more by not having <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">his</span></em> legs
        broken, the legs of the other two must on the contrary have been
        broken. The command not to break <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">his</span></em> legs
        necessarily implies that otherwise the legs of all would have been so
        broken. There is really no escape from this inference. Now the
        <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">crurifragium</span></span> is here represented
        as an act of mercy and to hasten death, but in the immediate context
        we are told that they were troubled and anxious lest the sun should
        have set whilst Jesus still lived. No anxiety of this kind is felt
        lest the malefactors should still be alive, and why? Because if an
        exception to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page067">[pg
        067]</span><a name="Pg067" id="Pg067" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        breaking the legs had been made in one case, and that exception had
        been Jesus, the malefactors would be supposed to be already dead. If,
        on the contrary, the legs of Jesus had been broken, they would not
        have feared his being alive, but rather the malefactor whose legs had
        not been broken. Jesus having been left to linger in torment is still
        alive, and the potion of vinegar and gall is given to him to produce
        death, and not to the malefactor. The whole context, therefore, shows
        that no means such as the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
        xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">crurifragium</span></span> had been used with
        Jesus to hasten death, and that the potion was at last given for the
        purpose. If, on the other hand, the legs of Jesus were actually
        broken, and not those of the malefactor, a most complete
        contradiction of the account in the fourth Gospel is given, and of
        the Scripture which is said in it to have been fulfilled.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Let us now see how
        the account in Peter compares with that in the fourth Gospel, on the
        hypothesis that the writer intended to represent that, in order to
        lengthen his sufferings, the legs of Jesus were not broken. It would
        follow that the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
        "la"><span style="font-style: italic">crurifragium</span></span> was
        applied to the two malefactors, and that Jesus was left to a
        lingering death by the cruel animosity of his executioners. It will,
        of course, be remembered that the fourth Gospel is the only one which
        recounts the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
        "la"><span style="font-style: italic">crurifragium</span></span>. In
        this narrative it is not represented as an act of mercy to shorten
        the sufferings of the crucified. It is said (xix. 31 f.):
        <span class="tei tei-q">“The Jews therefore, because it was the
        Preparation, that the bodies should not remain on the cross upon the
        Sabbath (for the day of that Sabbath was a high day), asked of Pilate
        that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.
        The soldiers therefore came, and brake the legs of the first, and of
        the other which was crucified with him; but when they came to Jesus,
        and saw that he was dead already, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page068">[pg 068]</span><a name="Pg068" id="Pg068" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> they brake not his legs ... that the Scripture
        might be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.”</span> The
        object of the author in relating this is obviously dogmatic, and to
        show the fulfilment of Scripture, but the way in which he brings the
        matter about is awkward, to say the least of it, and not so natural
        as that adopted by Peter. The soldiers brake the legs <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“of the first,”</span>—and by this description they imply
        that they begin at one end—and proceed to the second, who would be
        Jesus; but not so, for having broken the legs <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“of the first, and of the other,”</span> they come to
        Jesus, whom they must have passed over. Is this passing over of Jesus
        in the first instance a slight indication of a tradition similar to
        that which has been reproduced in Peter? However this may be, it is
        quite clear that, while the fourth Gospel deals with the episode
        purely from a dogmatic point of view, this is completely absent from
        Peter, who even leaves it in doubt, and as a problem for critics,
        whether the legs of Jesus were broken or not, and evidently does not
        give a thought to the Johannine representation of Jesus as the
        Paschal lamb. Whichever way the passage in Peter is construed, the
        entire independence of the writer from the influence of the fourth
        Gospel seems to be certain.</p>

        over the whole earth (ἐφ᾽ ὅλην τὴν γῆν) until the ninth hour.”</span>
        In Luke (xxiii. 44 f.) other details are, as usual, added:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“And it was now about the sixth hour, and a
        darkness came over the whole earth (ἐφ᾽ ὅλην τὴν γῆν) until the ninth
        hour, the sun failing [or rather <span class="tei tei-q">‘being
        eclipsed,’</span> τοῦ ἡλίου ἐκλειπόντος].”</span><a id="noteref_94"
        name="noteref_94" href="#note_94"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">94</span></span></a> It is a
        very extraordinary circumstance that, whether a miraculous eclipse or
        not, whether this darkness came over the whole land or the whole
        earth, the fourth Gospel has either not believed in it, or thought it
        unworthy of mention, for no reference to the astonishing phenomenon
        is found in it. Peter, in a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page070">[pg
        070]</span><a name="Pg070" id="Pg070" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        manner quite different from the Synoptics, and in fuller detail,
        describes this darkness and its effect upon the people. For the
        second time, he refers to a portion of the Jewish law, interpreted
        from Deut. xxi. 23, to illustrate the anxiety which the supposed
        going down of the sun had excited. This expression does not favour
        any theory of his being acquainted with the third Synoptic.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The most important
        part of the passage is that in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">v.</span></span> 16: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And one of them said: <span class="tei tei-q">‘Give him
        to drink gall with vinegar;’</span> and having mixed they gave him to
        drink.”</span> This proceeding is represented as the result of their
        anxiety at the sun going down whilst Jesus still lived, and the gall
        and vinegar are regarded as a potion to hasten death. This view is
        foreign to all of our Gospels. In Matthew xxvii. 48, when Jesus gives
        the loud cry, <span class="tei tei-q">“My God, my God,”</span>
        &amp;c., we read: <span class="tei tei-q">“And straightway one of
        them ran and took a sponge and filled it with vinegar, and put it on
        a reed, and gave him to drink. And the rest said, Let be; let us see
        whether Elijah cometh to save him.”</span> In Mark (xv. 36) the
        representation is almost the same. In both of these cases death
        follows almost immediately. In Luke (xxiii. 36) a very different
        representation is made. There is no such cry connected with it, but
        it is simply said: <span class="tei tei-q">“And the soldiers also
        mocked him, coming to him, offering him vinegar, and saying, If thou
        art the King of the Jews, save thyself.”</span> In John the episode
        has quite another, and purely dogmatic, tendency (xix. 28 ff.). It
        commences immediately after the episode of the mother and the beloved
        disciple, and without any previous cry: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“After this Jesus, knowing that all things are now
        finished, that the Scripture might be accomplished, saith, I thirst.
        There was set there a vessel full of vinegar; so they put a sponge
        full of vinegar upon <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page071">[pg
        071]</span><a name="Pg071" id="Pg071" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        hyssop, and brought it to his mouth. When Jesus therefore had
        received the vinegar, he said, It is finished; and he bowed his head
        and gave up his spirit.”</span> Of course the Scripture which is
        represented as being thus fulfilled is Psalm lxix. 21: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“... and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to
        drink.”</span> In all of these Gospels, the potion is simply vinegar,
        and being evidently associated with this Psalm, it is in no way
        connected with any baleful intention. The Psalm, however, commences:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“They gave me also gall for my meat,”</span>
        and in connection with the combination of gall with vinegar in Peter,
        as a potion to hasten death, it may be mentioned that the word which
        is in the Psalm translated <span class="tei tei-q">“gall”</span> may
        equally well be rendered <span class="tei tei-q">“poison”</span>—as,
        indeed, is also the case with the Latin <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“<span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
        "la"><span style="font-style: italic">fel</span></span>.”</span>
        Peter, by what is said in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">v.</span></span> 17—<span class="tei tei-q">“And
        they fulfilled all things, and completed their sins upon their own
        head”</span>—is more anxious to show that the Jews had put the final
        touch to their cruel work, in thus completing the death of Jesus,
        than to refer to the mere fulfilment of the Psalm. The only Gospel
        which mentions gall is the first Synoptic, in which it is said
        (xxvii. 34) that when they had brought Jesus to Golgotha before the
        crucifixion, <span class="tei tei-q">“They gave him wine to drink
        mingled with gall; and when he had tasted it, he would not
        drink.”</span> This is a very different representation from that of
        Peter, and the potion was obviously that often offered to persons
        about to suffer, in order to dull sensation. The passage might almost
        be represented as Docetic, from the writer's intention to show that
        Jesus refused to adopt a usual method of diminishing pain. There does
        not seem to be any warrant for supposing that the author of the
        fragment derived the passage we are examining from our Gospels, from
        which it is in all essential points distinct.</p><span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page072">[pg 072]</span><a name="Pg072" id="Pg072"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The narrative of
        the fragment continues, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">v.</span></span> 19: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And the Lord cried aloud, saying, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘Power, my Power, thou hast forsaken me!’</span> (ἡ
        δύναμίς μου, ἡ δύναμις, κατέλειψάς με), and having spoken, he was
        taken up (ἀνελήφθη).”</span> In this passage there is a very marked
        departure from the tradition followed by our four Gospels. Before
        considering the actual words of the cry recorded here, it may be
        desirable to form a general idea of the representations of the
        Synoptists and of the author of the fourth Gospel regarding the words
        spoken from the cross.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It might naturally
        have been supposed that, in describing the course of so solemn an
        event as the crucifixion, unusual care, securing unusual agreement,
        would have been exercised by Christian writers, and that the main
        facts—and still more the last words—of the great Master would have
        been collected. As we have already seen, however, in no portion of
        the history is there greater discrepancy in the accounts in the four
        Gospels, nor greater contradictions upon every point.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The same is the
        case with regard to what has still to be examined, and notably in the
        words and cries from the cross. In the first two Synoptics, with the
        exception of the inarticulate cry <span class="tei tei-q">“with a
        loud voice”</span> (Matt. xxvii. 50, Mark xv. 37) when yielding up
        his spirit, the only utterance recorded is one resembling that in
        Peter (Matt. xxvii. 46, Mark xv. 34): <span class="tei tei-q">“Eloi,
        Eloi, lama sabachthani? that is, My God, my God, why hast thou
        forsaken me?”</span><a id="noteref_95" name="noteref_95" href=
        "#note_95"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">95</span></span></a> (ἠλωί
        ἠλωί λαμὰ σαβαχθανεί? τοῦτ᾽ ἔστιν; θεέ μου, θεέ μου, ἵνα τί με
        ἐγκατέλιπες?). It will be observed that here there is a demonstration
        of great accuracy, in actually giving the original words used and
        translating them, which is uncommon in the Gospels. It is all the
        more extraordinary that neither of the other Gospels gives this
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page073">[pg 073]</span><a name="Pg073"
        id="Pg073" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> cry at all, but that they
        represent Jesus as uttering quite different words. The third
        Synoptist represents Jesus immediately after the crucifixion as
        saying (Luke xxiii. 34): <span class="tei tei-q">“Father, forgive
        them; for they know not what they do.”</span> The other evangelists
        do not evince any knowledge of this, and as little of the episode of
        the penitent thief (xxiii. 39 ff.)—which we have already
        considered—in which Jesus uses the remarkable words (v. 43):
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Verily I say unto thee, To-day shalt thou be
        with me in Paradise.”</span> In Luke, further, the inarticulate cry
        is interpreted (xxiii. 46): <span class="tei tei-q">“And when Jesus
        had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I
        commend my spirit; and having said this, he gave up the
        ghost.”</span> Of this the other Synoptists do not say anything. The
        author of the fourth Gospel has quite a different account to give
        from any of the Synoptists. He seems to be ignorant of the words
        which they report, and substitutes others of which they seem to know
        nothing. The episode of the penitent thief is replaced by the scene
        between Jesus and his mother and the disciple <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“whom he loved”</span> (xix. 25 ff.). Not only is this
        touching episode apparently unknown to the Synoptists, but the
        proximity of the women to the cross is in direct contradiction to
        what we find in Matthew and Mark, for in the former (xxvii. 55 f.) it
        is said that many women, <span class="tei tei-q">“among whom was Mary
        Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of
        the sons of Zebedee”</span> were <span class="tei tei-q">“beholding
        afar off;”</span> and the latter (xv. 40 f.) reports: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And there were also women beholding from afar: among
        whom were both Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James the less
        and of Joses, and Salome.”</span> In the fourth Gospel (xix. 28),
        Jesus is moreover reported to have said <span class="tei tei-q">“I
        thirst,”</span> in order <span class="tei tei-q">“that the Scripture
        might be accomplished”</span>—a fact which is not recorded in any of
        the Synoptics—and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page074">[pg
        074]</span><a name="Pg074" id="Pg074" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        having received vinegar upon hyssop, <span class="tei tei-q">“he
        said, It is finished, and he bowed his head and gave up his
        spirit.”</span> The last words of Jesus, therefore, according to the
        fourth Gospel, are different from any found in the three Synoptics.
        The Gospel of Peter differs as completely from the four canonical
        Gospels as they do from each other, and the whole account of the
        agony on the cross given in it is quite independent of them.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The only words
        recorded by Peter as uttered on the cross are those quoted higher up:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Power, my Power, thou hast forsaken
        me,”</span> the second <span class="tei tei-q">“my”</span> being
        omitted, and the question of the two Synoptics, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Why hast thou forsaken me?”</span> being changed into a
        declaration by the omission of ἵνα τί (or εἰς τί, Mark). We have
        already discussed the Docetic nature of this cry, and are now only
        considering it in relation to our Gospels. It is obvious that the
        substitution of <span class="tei tei-q">“Power, my Power”</span> for
        <span class="tei tei-q">“My God, my God”</span> introduces quite a
        different order of ideas, especially followed as it is by the
        remarkable statement: <span class="tei tei-q">“He was taken
        up.”</span> Eusebius tells us that Aquila rendered the words of Psalm
        xxii. 1—whence the first two Synoptists take their cry—as ἰσχυρέ μου,
        ἰσχυρέ μου (<span class="tei tei-q">“My strong one, my strong
        one”</span>), but that the more exact sense was ἰσχύσ μου, ἰσχύς μου
        (<span class="tei tei-q">“My strength, my strength”</span>);<a id=
        "noteref_96" name="noteref_96" href="#note_96"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">96</span></span></a> but
        though this is interesting as in some degree connecting the cry with
        the Psalm, it does not lessen the discrepancy between Peter and the
        Gospels, or in the least degree favour the theory of acquaintance
        with them.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The expression
        used to describe what follows this cry completes the wide separation
        between them: <span class="tei tei-q">“And having spoken, he was
        taken up”</span> (ἀνελήφθη). In the first Synoptic, after his cry
        (xxvii. 50), <span class="tei tei-q">“he yielded up the
        spirit”</span> (ἀφῆκεν τὸ πνεῦμα), whilst the second <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page075">[pg 075]</span><a name="Pg075" id="Pg075"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and third say (Mark xv. 37, Luke xxiii.
        46), <span class="tei tei-q">“he gave up the ghost”</span>
        ἐξέπνευσεν, and the fourth Gospel reads (xix. 30), <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“he delivered up the spirit”</span> (παρέδωκεν τὸ
        πνεῦμα). The representation in Peter is understood to be that the
        divine descended upon the human Christ in the form of the dove at
        baptism, and immediately ascended to Heaven again at his death. There
        is not here, however, any declaration of a double Christ, or any
        denial of the reality of the Christ's body, such as characterised the
        later Docetae; indeed, the fact that the dead body is still always
        spoken of as that of <span class="tei tei-q">“the Lord”</span> seems
        distinctly to exclude this, as does the whole subsequent narrative.
        Whatever Docetism there may be in this fragment is of the earliest
        type, if indeed its doctrines can be clearly traced at all; but
        undoubtedly when the sect had become pronounced heretics, orthodox
        Christians detected their subtle influence in much that was in itself
        very simple and harmless.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The fragment
        continues (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">v.</span></span> 20): <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And the same hour the veil of the Temple of Jerusalem
        was torn in twain”</span> (διεράγη τὸ καταπέτασμα τοῦ ναοῦ τῆς
        Ἰερουσαλὴμ εἰς δύο). This expression the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“temple of Jerusalem”</span> is one of those which seem
        to indicate that the Gospel was written away from Palestine, but in
        this it probably differs little from most of the canonical Gospels.
        The statement regarding the veil of the temple is almost the same in
        the first two Synoptics (Matt. xxvii. 51, Mark xv. 38). <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain
        from the top to the bottom”</span> (τὸ καταπέτασμα τοῦ ναοῦ ἐσχίσθη
        ἀπ᾽ ἄνωθεν ἕως κάτω εἰς δύο). In Luke (xxiii. 45) the rent is
        <span class="tei tei-q">“in the midst”</span> (μέσον), but otherwise
        the words are the same. The use of διεράγη instead of the ἐσχίσθη of
        the three Synoptics is characteristic. The fourth Gospel, strange to
        say, does not record at all this extraordinary phenomenon of the
        rending in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page076">[pg
        076]</span><a name="Pg076" id="Pg076" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        twain of the veil of the temple. There are some further peculiarities
        which must be pointed out. The third Synoptist sets the rending of
        the veil before Jesus cried with a loud voice and gave up the ghost;
        whilst in Matthew and Mark it is after the cry and giving up the
        spirit. Moreover, in Matthew, it is associated with an earthquake,
        and the rending of the rocks and opening of tombs, and the astounding
        circumstance that many bodies of the saints that had fallen asleep
        were raised, and coming forth out of the tombs after his resurrection
        they entered into the holy city, and appeared unto many: of all of
        which the other three Gospels make no mention, nor does Peter in this
        connection.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The narrative in

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This passage is
        full of independent peculiarities. Although none of the canonical
        Gospels, except Matthew, says anything of an earthquake, and the
        first Synoptist associates it with the moment when Jesus <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“gave up the ghost,”</span> Peter narrates that when the
        body of the Lord was unloosed from the cross, the moment it was laid
        on the ground the whole earth quaked beneath the awful burden: a
        representation almost grander than anything in the four Gospels.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The canonical
        Gospels do not speak of the nails being <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page077">[pg 077]</span><a name="Pg077" id="Pg077" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> taken out, and although Peter states that they
        were removed from the hands, he does not refer to the feet. The
        fourth is the only canonical Gospel that speaks of the nails at all,
        and there it is not in connection with the crucifixion, but the
        subsequent appearance to the disciples and the incredulity of Thomas
        (xx. 20, 25, 27). Here also, only the marks in the hands are referred
        to. The difference of the two representations is so great that there
        can really be no question of dependence, and those who are so eager
        to claim the use of the fourth Gospel simply because it is the only
        one that speaks of <span class="tei tei-q">“nails”</span>
        (<span class="tei tei-q">“the print of the nails”</span>) might
        perhaps consider that the idea of crucifixion and the cross might
        well be independently associated with a reference to the nails by
        which the victim was generally attached. In the third Synoptic (xxiv.
        39), the inference is inevitable that both hands and feet were
        supposed to be nailed. When the report, <span class="tei tei-q">“The
        Lord is risen,”</span> is brought to the eleven, Jesus is represented
        as standing in their midst and assuring them that he was not a
        spirit, by saying: <span class="tei tei-q">“See my hands and my feet,
        that it is I myself”</span>—meaning of course the prints of the nails
        in both. The statement in Peter that on the occurrence of the
        earthquake <span class="tei tei-q">“great fear came [upon
        them]”</span> (φόβος μέγας ἐγένετο) is not even mentioned in Matthew
        when he narrates the earthquake, which he represents as occurring
        when Jesus expired. The expression is characteristic of the author,
        who uses it elsewhere.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The representation
        that the sun shone out and that the Jews were glad when they found it
        was the ninth hour, and that consequently their law, twice quoted by
        the author, would not be broken, is limited to the fragment; as is
        also the statement that they gave his body to Joseph that he might
        bury it, <span class="tei tei-q">“for he had beheld the good works
        that he did.”</span> As we have already seen, <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page078">[pg 078]</span><a name="Pg078" id="Pg078"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the canonical Gospels represent Joseph as
        going to Pilate at this time and begging for the body of Jesus, and
        it will be remembered that, in Mark (xv. 44), it is said that
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Pilate marvelled if he were already
        dead,”</span> and called the centurion to ascertain the fact before
        he granted the body. In Peter, the body was of course given in
        consequence of the previous order, when Pilate asked Herod for
        it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Joseph is
        represented, here, as only washing the body and wrapping it in linen
        (λαβὼν δὲ τὸν κύριον ἔλουσε καὶ εἴλησε σινδόνι). The first Synoptist
        (xxvii. 59) says that Joseph took the body and <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“wrapped it in a clean linen cloth”</span> (ἐνετύλιξεν
        αὐτὸ [ἐν] σινδόνι καθαρᾷ). Mark similarly describes that (xv. 46),
        bringing <span class="tei tei-q">“a linen cloth and taking him down,
        he wound him in the linen cloth”</span> (καθελὼν αὐτὸν ἐνείλησεν τῇ
        σινδόνι). The third Synoptist has nearly the same statement and
        words. The fourth Gospel has a much more elaborate account to give
        (xix. 38 ff.). Joseph goes to Pilate asking that he may take away the
        body, and Pilate gives him leave. He comes and takes away the body.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“And there came also Nicodemus ... bringing a
        mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pound <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">weight</span></em>.
        So they took the body of Jesus and bound it in linen clothes (καὶ
        ἔδησαν αὐτὸ ὀθονίοις) with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is
        to bury.”</span> This account is quite different from that in the
        Synoptics, and equally so from Peter's, which approximates much more
        nearly to that in the latter.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Peter says that
        Joseph then <span class="tei tei-q">“brought him into his own grave,
        called <span class="tei tei-q">‘Joseph's Garden’</span> ”</span>
        (εἰσήγαγεν εἰς ἴδιον τάφον καλούμενον Κῆπον Ἰωσήφ). The account of
        the tomb is much more minute in the canonical Gospels. In Matthew
        (xxvii. 60), Joseph is said to lay the body <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“in his own new tomb (μνημείῳ), which he had hewn out
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page079">[pg 079]</span><a name="Pg079"
        id="Pg079" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> in the rock; and he rolled a
        great stone to the door of the tomb (μνημείου) and departed.”</span>
        In Mark (xv. 46), he lays him <span class="tei tei-q">“in a tomb
        (μνήματι) which had been hewn out of a rock; and he rolled a stone
        against the door of the tomb”</span> (μνημείου). Luke has a new
        detail to chronicle (xxiii. 53): Joseph lays him <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“in a tomb (μνηματί) that was hewn in stone, where never
        man had yet lain.”</span> The first two Synopists, it will be
        observed, say that Joseph rolls a stone against the entrance to the
        tomb: but neither Luke nor Peter has this detail, though the former
        leaves it to be inferred that it had been done, for (xxiv. 2) the
        women who came on the first day of the week find the stone rolled
        away from the tomb. In Peter, on the contrary, the stone is rolled
        against the tomb by the guard and others later, as we shall presently
        see.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the fourth
        Gospel, the account has further and different details, agreeing,
        however, with the peculiar statement of Luke (xix. 41 f.):
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Now in the place where he was crucified
        there was a garden (κῆπος), and in the garden a new tomb (μνημεῖον)
        wherein was never man yet laid. There then, because of the Jews'
        Preparation (for the tomb [μνημεῖον] was nigh at hand), they laid
        Jesus.”</span> Some stress has been laid upon the point that both
        Peter and the fourth Gospel use the word <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“garden,”</span> and that none of the Synoptics have it,
        and as these critics seem to go upon the principle that any statement
        in Peter which happens to be in any canonical Gospel, even although
        widely different in treatment, must have been derived from that
        Gospel, and not from any similar written or traditional source, from
        which that Gospel derived it, they argue that this shows dependence
        on the fourth Gospel. There is certainly no evidence of dependence
        here. In Peter, the grave (τάφος) is simply <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page080">[pg 080]</span><a name="Pg080" id="Pg080" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> said to be called <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Joseph's Garden”</span> (Κήπον Ἰωσηφ),<a id="noteref_98"
        name="noteref_98" href="#note_98"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">98</span></span></a> and
        described as <span class="tei tei-q">“his own grave.”</span> The
        fourth Gospel does not identify the garden as Joseph's at all, but
        says that <span class="tei tei-q">“in the place where he was
        crucified there was a garden,”</span> and in it <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“a tomb”</span> (μνημεῖον), and the reason given for
        taking the body thither is not that it belonged to Joseph, but that
        the tomb <span class="tei tei-q">“was nigh at hand,”</span> and that
        on account of the Jews' Preparation they laid it there. The whole
        explanation seems to exclude the idea that the writer knew that it
        belonged to Joseph. Peter simply contributes a new detail to the
        common tradition. There is no appearance of his deriving this from
        our canonical Gospels, from which he differs in substance and in
        language. Neither Peter nor the Synoptics know anything of the
        co-operation of Nicodemus.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The narrative in
        the fragment continues:</p>

        <div class="block tei tei-quote" style=
        "margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">
        <span style="font-size: 90%">25. Then the Jews and the elders and the
        priests, seeing the evil they had done to themselves, began to beat
        their breasts (ἤρξαντο κόπτεσθαι) and to say:</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style=
        "font-size: 90%">Woe for our sins; judgment draweth nigh and the end
        of Jerusalem.</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>
        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have already
        discussed this passage in connection with the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Diatessaron,”</span> and have now only to consider it as
        compared with our Gospels. There is no equivalent in any of them,
        except that the third Synoptist (xxiii. 48) says that when Jesus gave
        up the ghost: <span class="tei tei-q">“All the multitude that came
        together to this sight, when they beheld the things that were done,
        returned smiting their breasts (τύπτοντες τὰ στήθη
        ὑπέστρεφον).”</span> The reason for this change of mood is, of
        course, the eclipse and consequent darkness in the third Synoptic,
        and the earthquake and darkness in Peter; but in the former
        <span class="tei tei-q">“all the multitude”</span> smite their
        breasts, and in the latter <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page081">[pg
        081]</span><a name="Pg081" id="Pg081" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the Jews and the elders and the
        priests.”</span> It may be suggested whether the words inserted in
        the ancient Latin Codex of St. Germain, <span class="tei tei-q">“Vae
        nobis, quae facta sunt hodie propter peccata nostra, appropinquavit
        enim desolatio Hierusalem,”</span><a id="noteref_99" name=

        have been taken from our Gospel of Peter, for an expansion of the
        original text of the third Synoptic, by the author of this
        version.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The common
        reference of the fragment is to <span class="tei tei-q">“the
        Jews,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“the Jews and the elders and
        the priests,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“the scribes and
        Pharisees and elders,”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“the elders
        and scribes.”</span> Throughout the same part of the narrative in
        Matthew, we have <span class="tei tei-q">“the scribes and
        elders,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“chief priests and elders of
        the people”</span> (this, most frequently), <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“chief priests with the scribes and elders,”</span> and
        in speaking of the guard at the sepulchre, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the chief priests and the Pharisees.”</span> In Mark,
        the same leaders are named, whilst in Luke we have <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the chief priests and captains of the Temple and
        elders,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“the elders of the people and
        both the chief priests and scribes,”</span> and, repeatedly, the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“chief priests and rulers.”</span> The fourth
        Gospel usually cites <span class="tei tei-q">“the chief priests and
        Pharisees,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“chief captains and
        officers of the Jews,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“the
        Jews,”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“the chief priests of the
        Jews.”</span> There is more analogy, in this respect, between the
        fragment and the fourth Gospel than between it and the Synoptics.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We come now to an
        important and characteristic part of the fragment:</p>

        <div class="block tei tei-quote" style=
        "margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">
        <span style="font-size: 90%">26. And I, with my companions, was
        mourning, and being pierced in spirit we hid ourselves; for we were
        sought for by them as malefactors, and as desiring to burn the
        temple. 27. Over all these things, however, we were fasting, and sat
        mourning and weeping night and day until the Sabbath.</span>
        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is no
        parallel to this passage in our Gospels, but in the statement that
        the Apostles had hidden themselves <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page082">[pg 082]</span><a name="Pg082" id="Pg082" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> (and—taken in connection with v. 59, where the
        same fact is again mentioned—this means all the twelve) we have here
        agreement with the narrative of the first and second Synoptics (Matt.
        xxvi. 56; Mark xix. 50), that on the arrest of Jesus <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“all the disciples left him and fled.”</span> This
        passage seems to exclude the incident of the sword and Malchus which,
        as Hilgenfeld points out,<a id="noteref_100" name="noteref_100" href=
        "#note_100"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">100</span></span></a> is also
        excluded by a passage in Justin; the denial of Peter, which Justin
        equally passes over unmentioned; and the episode of the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“beloved disciple”</span> by the cross. The reason given
        for hiding themselves, that they were accused of wishing to burn the
        temple, has some connection with the tradition, that testimony had
        been given against Jesus that he had said he could destroy this
        temple and build it in three days (Matt. xxvi. 60; Mark xiv.
        58).<a id="noteref_101" name="noteref_101" href=
        "#note_101"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">101</span></span></a> The
        passage is one of those in which the writer speaks in the first
        person and represents himself as an Apostle, which he still more
        clearly does, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">v.</span></span> 60, where he distinctly calls
        himself Simon Peter.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The account that
        the Apostles were fasting and sat mourning and weeping <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“night and day until the Sabbath”</span> (νυκτὸς καὶ
        ἡμέρας ἕως τοῦ σαββάτου) opens out an interesting problem. As a rule,
        the Greek expression would be ἡμέρας καὶ νυκτός, so if we are to take
        the words actually used as deliberately intended to represent the
        time, we should have to count at least one night and one day between
        the death of Jesus and the Sabbath, or in other words, that the
        crucifixion took place, not on Friday, but upon Thursday, which,
        according to the statement in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">v.</span></span> 5, would really be the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page083">[pg 083]</span><a name="Pg083"
        id="Pg083" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> 13th Nisan. A great deal might

        need not be entered into here. It is probable that, as Harnack
        suggests,<a id="noteref_103" name="noteref_103" href=
        "#note_103"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        author really thinks of the whole time from the Thursday night, when
        the arrest was made.</p>

          Ye have a guard: go your way, make it as sure as ye can. So they
          went, and made the sepulchre sure (ἠσφαλίσαντο τὸν τάφον), sealing

        one of the four canonical Gospels has any reference to this episode,
        or betrays the slightest knowledge of any precautions taken to guard
        the tomb, is remarkable. The analogies in the narrative in Peter with
        the general account, and the similarity of the language in certain
        parts, together with the wide variation in details and language
        generally, point to the conclusion that both writers derive the
        episode from a similar source, but independently of each other. The
        casual agreement with continuous dissimilarity of statement and
        style, are evidence of the separate treatment of a common tradition,
        and put the fragment upon a very different footing from the Synoptics
        in relation to each other. The absence of verisimilitude is pretty
        nearly equal in both Gospels, but these traditions grew up, and were
        unconsciously rounded by the contributions of pious imagination.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the fragment it
        is <span class="tei tei-q">“the scribes and Pharisees and
        elders”</span> (οἱ γραμματεῖς καὶ Φαρισαῖοι καὶ πρεσβύτεροι) who meet
        together, but only the <span class="tei tei-q">“elders”</span> go to
        Pilate; in the Synoptic, <span class="tei tei-q">“the chief Priests
        and the Pharisees”</span> (οἱ ἀρχιερεῖς καὶ οἱ Φαρισαῖοι) meet and go
        to Pilate. Pilate gives them <span class="tei tei-q">“Petronius the
        centurion with soldiers”</span> to watch the tomb; in Matthew, he
        gives them <span class="tei tei-q">“a guard,”</span> bidding them
        make it sure; so they go and seal <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page085">[pg 085]</span><a name="Pg085" id="Pg085" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> the stone, the guard being with them. In Peter,
        the <span class="tei tei-q">“elders and scribes”</span> go to the
        grave, and themselves with the soldiers, <span class="tei tei-q">“all
        who were there together,”</span> roll a great stone and set it at the
        door of the grave. Doubtless this trait is intended to convey an
        impression of the great size of the stone. A curious peculiarity
        occurs in the statement, <span class="tei tei-q">“they roll the stone
        against the centurion and the soldiers,”</span> the intention of the
        words probably being that, in their suspicious mood, they thus
        protected themselves from possible fraud on the part even of the
        soldiers.<a id="noteref_104" name="noteref_104" href=
        "#note_104"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">104</span></span></a> The
        motive for the application to Pilate, in the fragment, is fear on the
        part of the elders, in consequence of the murmuring and lamentation
        of the people, who are represented as being convinced by the great
        signs occurring at the death of Jesus <span class="tei tei-q">“how
        just a one”</span> he was. This is quite a variation from the
        Synoptic version, but both agree in the explanation given to Pilate
        of anxiety lest the disciples should steal the body, and say that
        Jesus had risen from the dead. In Matthew, they simply <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“seal the stone,”</span> but in the fragment they put or
        smear (ἐπέχρισαν) <span class="tei tei-q">“seven seals”</span> upon
        it. Some important peculiarities then occur in the narrative of
        Peter. They set up a tent beside the tomb and keep guard, and in the
        morning a multitude from Jerusalem and the neighbourhood come out to
        see the sealed-up grave. There is nothing corresponding to this in
        the Synoptic Gospel.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The narrative
        proceeds:</p>

        <span style="font-size: 90%">35. Now, in the night before the dawn of
        the Lord's day (ἡ κυριακή), whilst the soldiers were keeping guard
        over the place, two and two in a watch, there was a great voice in
        the heaven. 36. And they saw the heavens opened and two men come down
        from thence with great light and approach the tomb. 37. But the stone
        which had been laid at the door rolled of itself away by the side,
        and the tomb was opened and both the young men entered.</span>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here commences an
        account of the resurrection very different in every respect from that
        in our canonical Gospels, and the treatment of a tradition in some
        points necessarily common to all is evidently independent. In
        Matthew, the scene commences with an earthquake—earthquakes are,
        indeed, peculiar to the first Synoptist—(xxviii. 2 f.): <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And behold there was a great earthquake; for an angel of
        the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled away the stone
        and sat upon it. His appearance was as lightning, and his raiment
        white as snow; and for fear of him the watchers did quake and become
        as dead men.”</span> Here only one angel comes down, whilst in Peter
        there are two men, whom some critics—amongst whom may be mentioned
        Nestle, with whom Harnack is inclined to agree, more especially as
        they are never called angels, but merely <span class="tei tei-q">“two
        men”</span>—identify as Moses and Elias. The angel rolls away the
        stone, which in Peter rolls away of itself, and sits upon it, whilst
        in Peter the two men enter into the tomb. No account is given in Mark
        of the opening of the tomb, the women simply finding the stone rolled
        away, and a young man (νεανίσκον) sitting on the right side arrayed
        in a white robe (xvi. 4 f.); the author does not mention any
        earthquake. In the third Synoptic (xxiv. 2 f.), the women also find
        the stone already rolled away from the tomb; there is no earthquake.
        When the women enter the tomb they do not find <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the body of the Lord Jesus,”</span> but while they are
        perplexed two men stand by them in dazzling apparel. In the fourth
        Gospel (xx. 12 f.), Mary, coming to the sepulchre, sees two angels in
        white sitting—the one at the head, the other at the foot—where the
        body of Jesus had lain. Thus, to sum up, in Matthew there is one
        angel, in Mark one young man, in Luke two <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page087">[pg 087]</span><a name="Pg087" id="Pg087" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> men, in the fourth Gospel two angels, and in
        Peter two men descend from heaven to the tomb.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Peter goes on:</p>

        <span style="font-size: 90%">38. Then these soldiers, seeing this,
        awakened the centurion and the elders, for they also were keeping
        watch. 39. And whilst they were narrating to them what they had seen,
        they beheld again three men coming out of the tomb and the two were
        supporting the one, and a cross following them. 40. And the heads of
        the two indeed reached up to the heaven, but that of him that was led
        by their hands rose above the heavens. 41. And they heard a voice
        from the heavens saying,</span> <span class=

          <span style="font-size: 90%">42. And an answer was heard from the
          cross:</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of course there is
        nothing corresponding to this in the canonical Gospels. In Matthew,
        the watchers quake and become as dead men, but no such alarm is here
        described. The elders and soldiers see the two men who had entered
        the tomb come out leading a third, and the stately appearance of the
        three is described with Oriental extravagance.<a id="noteref_105"

        Following the three is a cross, a very singular representation, more
        especially as the cross presently speaks. Harnack says that Duhms,
        who supposes a Hebraic original, conjectures that the Hebrew word,
        which could as well stand for <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“crucified”</span> as <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“cross,”</span> was misunderstood by the translator, and
        he adds that, if the original was Aramaic, the matter becomes still
        simpler. However, Harnack does not seem disposed to adopt the
        suggestion.<a id="noteref_106" name="noteref_106" href=
        "#note_106"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">106</span></span></a> It is
        well known that in very early works the cross was identified with the
        crucified, and treated both as a type and as having a certain
        personality—the living and eloquent symbol of victory over
        death.<a id="noteref_107" name="noteref_107" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The passage which
        we have quoted from Matthew (xxvii. 52 f.) must be recalled, in which
        the first Synoptic alone of the four canonical Gospels has an account
        of astonishing events said to have occurred at the death of Jesus: an
        earthquake which rent the rocks and opened the tombs, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“and many bodies of the saints that were sleeping
        (κεκοιμημένων) were raised; and coming forth out of the tombs after
        his resurrection, they entered into the holy city and appeared unto
        many.”</span> This resurrection of the saints <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“that were sleeping”</span> is associated by Eusebius
        with the descent into hell,<a id="noteref_112" name="noteref_112"

        is not improbable that the first Synoptist had it in his mind. It is

        interesting passage may be quoted from Justin. He accuses the Jews of
        omitting from the prophecy of Jeremiah in their copies of the
        Septuagint the following verse: <span class="tei tei-q">“The Lord
        God, the Holy one of Israel, remembered his dead who lay sleeping
        (κεκοιμημένων) in the earth, and descended to them to bring to them

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The writer does

        "tei tei-anchor"></a> the three who came out of the tomb, two of whom
        were <span class="tei tei-q">“supporting,”</span> or, as is
        subsequently said, leading him, or conducting him, but this figure,
        more stately than the others, of course, is intended to be recognised
        as Jesus. Too much has been said as to the weakness supposed to be
        here described, and Zahn, who as much as possible ridicules the whole
        contents of the fragment, says that <span class="tei tei-q">“the
        raised Lazarus, in comparison with him, is a hero in strength and
        life.”</span> But is the intention here to depict weakness? No word
        is used which really demands that interpretation. As Dr. Swete
        rightly points out, <span class="tei tei-q">“the support appears to
        be regarded as nominal only, since He is also said to be <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘conducted’</span> (χειραγωγουμένον)”</span> (p. 18). It
        is true that χειραγωγεῖν is twice used in Acts (ix. 8, xxii. 11) to
        express Paul's helplessness when led by the hand after his vision on
        the way to Damascus, but it does not in itself imply weakness, and no
        other hint of feebleness is given in the fragment. The <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“touch me not”</span> of the fourth Gospel, when Mary
        Magdalene stretches out her hand to Jesus, is quite as much a mark of
        weakness as this. It may not unfairly, on the other hand, be
        interpreted as a mark of honour, and nothing in Peter forbids this
        reading. If weakness were indicated, it might be taken as a Docetic
        representation of the condition of the human body, deprived of the
        divine Christ, who had ascended from the cross.</p>

        of care. So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the centurion
        and soldiers in Peter go to Pilate after witnessing the events
        described as occurring at the resurrection, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“fearing greatly”</span> (ἀγωνιῶντες μεγάλως), they say,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Truly he was a Son of God”</span> (ἀληθῶς
        υἱὸς ἦν θεοῦ). It will be remembered that, in the first Synoptic,
        when the centurion and they that were watching Jesus saw the
        earthquake and the things that were done when he expired, they
        <span class="tei tei-q">“feared exceedingly”</span> (ἐφοβήθησαν
        σφόδρα), and said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Truly this was a Son of
        God”</span> (ἀληθῶς θεοῦ υἱὸς ἦν οὗτος). The tradition of the
        astonished centurion bearing such testimony to Jesus is known to both
        writers, but under different circumstances, and independently
        treated. In <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page092">[pg
        092]</span><a name="Pg092" id="Pg092" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        similar fashion, the reply put into the mouth of Pilate in Peter,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“I am pure of the blood (ἐγὼ καθαρεύω τοῦ
        αἵματος) of the Son of God, but thus it seemed good unto you,”</span>
        is, to a certain extent, the same as Pilate's declaration to the
        multitude after washing his hands (xxvii. 24 f.): <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I am innocent of the blood of this righteous man (ἀθῶός
        εἰμι ἀπὸ τοῦ αἵματος τοῦ δικαίου τούτου): see ye to it;”</span> but
        in this case, as well as the other, the details and the language show
        an independent use of a similar source. In the Synoptic, the
        centurion and soldiers do not go to Pilate at all, but are bribed by
        the chief priests and elders to say that his disciples stole him by
        night when they slept. They are warned by Pilate to be altogether
        silent, in Peter. As the desire of the author is represented to be to
        remove responsibility from Pilate and throw it all upon the Jews, it
        is difficult to conceive that, if he had this account before him, he
        could deliberately have left it unused, and preferred his own
        account.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We need not remark
        that in all essential points the account given here is different from
        that in our Gospels.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In each of the
        three Synoptics, it is said that the women saw where Jesus was laid,
        and the first two name Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Jesus
        (Mark <span class="tei tei-q">“the other Mary”</span>), Matt. xxvii.
        61, Mark xv. 47, Luke xxiii. 55. All four canonical Gospels relate
        their coming to the sepulchre: Matthew (xxviii. 1), <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“late on the Sabbath day, as it began to dawn toward the
        first day of the week;”</span> Mark (xvi. 1), <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“when the Sabbath was past;”</span> Luke (xxiv. 1),
        <span class="tei tei-q">“on the first day of the week at early
        dawn;”</span> but only the second and third state that they bring
        spices to anoint Jesus; in Matthew the purpose stated being merely
        <span class="tei tei-q">“to see the sepulchre.”</span> In the fourth
        Gospel, only Mary Magdalene comes, and no reason is assigned. In
        Peter, Mary Magdalene only is named, but she takes her women friends,
        and though spices are not directly named, they are distinctly
        implied, and the object of the visit to the tomb, admirably described
        as <span class="tei tei-q">“that which women are accustomed to do for
        those who die and are loved by them,”</span> which they had not been
        able to do on the day of the crucifixion, through fear of the Jews.
        Even now the same fear is upon them; but nothing is said of it in the
        four Gospels.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page094">[pg
        094]</span><a name="Pg094" id="Pg094" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The only part of
        the words put into their mouths by the author which at all
        corresponds with anything in the canonical narratives is that
        regarding the opening of the sepulchre. <span class="tei tei-q">“But
        who will roll us away the stone that is laid at the door of the
        grave?”</span> (τίς δὲ ἀποκυλίσει ἡμῖν καὶ τὸν λίθον τὸν τεθέντα, ἐπὶ
        τῆς θύρας τοῦ μνημείου?). In Matthew, an angel had rolled away the
        stone, but in Mark the women are represented as asking the same
        question among themselves (xvi. 3), <span class="tei tei-q">“Who
        shall roll us away the stone from the door of the grave?”</span> (τίς
        ἀποκυλίσει ἡμῖν τὸν λίθον ἐκ τῆς θύρας τοῦ μνημείου?) practically in
        the same words. To appreciate the relative importance of the
        similarity in this detail it should be remembered that the same words
        are used with slight grammatical changes in the other two Synoptics:
        Matt. xxviii. 2, the angel <span class="tei tei-q">“rolled away the
        stone”</span> (ἀπεκύλισε τὸν λίθον); and Luke xxiv. 2, they found
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the stone rolled away from the grave”</span>
        (τὸν λίθον ἀποκεκυλισμένον ἀπὸ τοῦ μνημείου). The privilege of using
        a similar source of tradition must also be accorded to the author of
        the fragment.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The women in
        Peter, after a few more words explanatory of their purpose in going
        to the sepulchre, use an expression to which so much importance has
        been attached by Zahn that, to render it intelligible, it must be
        connected with the context just discussed. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“But who will roll away the stone that is laid at the
        door of the grave, in order that we may enter and set ourselves by
        him, and do the things that are due? For great was the stone (μέγας
        γὰρ ἦν ὁ λίθος), and we fear lest some one should see us.”</span> Now
        in the second Synoptic (xvi. 4) we read that the women, looking up,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“see that the stone (λίθος) is rolled back;
        for it was exceeding great”</span> (ἦν γὰρ μέγας σφόδρα). Zahn says:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Just as certainly can the dependence of the
        Gospel of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page095">[pg
        095]</span><a name="Pg095" id="Pg095" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        Peter on Mark be proved. A proof scarcely to be refuted lies even in
        the one little word ἦν, which is mechanically taken from Mark xvi.

        "#note_116"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">116</span></span></a> To one
        so willing to be convinced, what might not be proved by many little
        words in the canonical Gospels? It must be remembered that none of
        our Synoptics sprang full-fledged from the original tradition, but,
        as is recognised by every critic competent to form an opinion, is
        based on previous works and records of tradition, which gradually
        grew into this more complete form. Any one who wishes to realise this
        should examine Rushbrooke's <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Synopticon,”</span> which, at a glance, will show the
        matter and the language common to our first three Gospels, and leave
        little doubt as to the common origin of these works. It may be useful
        towards a proper understanding of the problem before us if we give a
        single illustration of the construction of the Synoptics taken from
        the very part of the narrative at which we have arrived. We shall
        arrange it in parallel columns for facility of
        comparison.</p><a name="Pg096" id="Pg096" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such close
        similarity as this, with occasional astonishing omissions of matter
        and flagrant contradictions where independent narrative is attempted,
        runs <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page098">[pg 098]</span><a name=
        "Pg098" id="Pg098" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> through the whole of
        the three Synoptics. This is not the place to enter upon any
        discussion of these phenomena, or any explanation of the origin of
        our Gospels, but apologists may be invited to consider the fact
        before passing judgment on the Gospel of Peter. Any coincidence of
        statement in the narrative of the fragment with any one of the four
        Gospels is promptly declared to be decisive evidence of dependence on
        that Gospel; and even the use of a word which has a parallel in them
        is sufficient reason for denouncing the author as a plagiarist. It
        would almost seem as if such critics had never read the prologue to
        the third Synoptic, and forgotten the πολλοί to which its author
        refers, when they limit the Christian tradition to these Gospels,
        which again, upon examination, must themselves be limited to two—the
        Synoptic and the Johannine, which in so great a degree contradict
        each other.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To return now to
        the passage which we have to examine. It will be observed that the
        second Synoptic treats the episode of the women in a manner different
        from the other two, but in the same style, though with very differing
        details, as Peter. We shall show reason for believing that both have
        drawn from the same source, but that the fragment has probably
        adhered more closely to the original source. In Mark (xvi. 3 f.) the
        women are, as in Peter, represented as speaking: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And they were saying among themselves, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the
        tomb?’</span> ”</span> Here the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">spoken</span></em> words stop, and the writer
        continues to narrate: <span class="tei tei-q">“And looking up, they
        see that the stone <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">is</span></em> rolled back (ἀνακεκύλισται): for
        it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">was</span></em> (ἦν) exceeding great.”</span> It
        is obvious that the <span class="tei tei-q">“was”</span> here is
        quite out of place, and it seems impossible to avoid the conclusion
        that, originally, it must have stood with a different context. That
        different context we have in Peter. The <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page099">[pg 099]</span><a name="Pg099" id="Pg099" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> women say amongst themselves: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Who will roll us away the stone that is laid at the door
        of the grave, in order that we may enter”</span>—and, of course, in
        saying this they are supposed to have in their minds the stone which
        they had seen the evening before and, naturally, express their
        recollection of it in the past tense—<span class="tei tei-q">“for it
        was exceeding great.”</span> If the phrase has been mechanically
        introduced, it has been so by the second Synoptist, in whose text it
        is more out of place than in Peter. A prescriptive right to early
        traditions of this kind cannot reasonably be claimed for any writer,
        simply because his compilation has happened to secure a place in the
        Canon.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the women
        come to the tomb, they stoop down (παρέκυψαν) and see there (ὁρῶσιν
        ἐκεῖ) a certain young man (τινα νεανίσκον) sitting in the midst of
        the tomb, beautiful and clad in a shining garment (ὡραῖον καὶ
        περιβεβλημένον στολὴν λαμπροτάτην). This is the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“certain man”</span> who descended when the heavens were
        again opened, as described in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">v.</span></span> 44. The realistic touch of the
        women stooping to look into the low entrance of the tomb is repeated
        when the <span class="tei tei-q">“young man”</span> bids them
        <span class="tei tei-q">“stoop down”</span> (παρακύψατε) and convince
        themselves that Jesus had risen. This does not occur in any of the
        Synoptics; but in the fourth Gospel (xx. 5), Peter, it is said,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“stooping down”</span> (παρακύψας) sees
        (βλέπει) the clothes. In Matthew, the angel sits upon the stone which
        he has rolled away, and not in the sepulchre, and his description is
        (xxviii. 3): <span class="tei tei-q">“His appearance was as
        lightning, and his raiment white as snow”</span> (ἦν δὲ ἡ εἰδέα αὐτοῦ
        ὡς ἀστραπὴ, καὶ τὸ ἔνδυμα αὐτοῦ λευκὸν ὡς χιών). In Mark (xvi. 8),
        they see a <span class="tei tei-q">“young man”</span> (νεανίσκον)
        sitting on the right side, and not in the middle, and he is
        <span class="tei tei-q">“clad in a white robe”</span> (περιβεβλημένον
        στολὴν λευκήν). In Luke (xxiv. 4), two men (ἄνδρες δύο) stand by the
        women <span class="tei tei-q">“in dazzling apparel”</span> (ἐν ἐσθῆτι
        ἀστραπτούσῃ). <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page100">[pg
        100]</span><a name="Pg100" id="Pg100" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> In
        the fourth Gospel (xx. 12), Mary sees two angels sitting, the one at
        the head, the other at the feet, where the body had lain, but they
        are simply said to be <span class="tei tei-q">“in white”</span> (ἐν
        λευκοῖς).</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“young man”</span> says to the women in Peter:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Why are ye come? (τί ἤλθατε?) Whom seek ye?
        (τίνα ζητεῖτε?) Him who was crucified? (μὴ τὸν σταυρωθέντα ἐκεῖνον?)
        He is risen and gone away (ἀνέστη καὶ ἀπῆλθεν). But if ye do not
        believe, stoop down, and see the place where he lay (παρακύψατε καὶ
        ἴδατε τὸν τόπον ἔνθα ἔκείτο), that he is not there, for he is risen
        and gone away thither whence he was sent (ἀνέστη γὰρ καὶ ἀπῆλθεν ἐκεῖ
        ὅθεν ἀπεστάλη).”</span> In Matthew (xxviii. 5 f.) the angel
        <span class="tei tei-q">“answered and said unto the women”</span>
        (who had not spoken to him, apparently) <span class="tei tei-q">“Fear
        not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus which hath been crucified (οἶδα
        γὰρ ὅτι Ἰησοῦν τὸν ἐσταυρωμένον ζητεῖτε). He is not here, for he rose
        (οὐκ ἔστιν ὧδε, ἠγέρθη γάρ), even as he said. Come, see the place
        where the Lord lay (δεῦτε ἴδετε τὸν τόπον ὅπου ἔκειτο). And go
        quickly, and tell his disciples he rose from the dead (ἠγέρθη ἀπὸ τῶν
        νεκρῶν); and lo, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see
        him: lo, I have told you.”</span> In Mark (xvi. 6 f.), this
        <span class="tei tei-q">“young man”</span> in the tomb says:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Be not amazed; ye seek Jesus the Nazarene
        which hath been crucified (Ἰησοῦν ζητεῖτε τὸν Ναζαρηνὸν τὸν
        ἐσταυρωμένον). He rose (ἠγέρθη); he is not here; behold, the place
        where they laid him! (οὐκ ἔστιν ὧδε; ἴδε ὁ τόπος ὅπου ἔθηκαν αὐτόν).
        But go tell his disciples and Peter, He goeth before you into
        Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto you.”</span> The
        close resemblance of these two accounts in the first and second
        Gospels is striking, and scarcely less so is the resemblance, with
        important variations, of the third Synoptic (xxiv. 5 ff.). The
        <span class="tei tei-q">“two <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page101">[pg 101]</span><a name="Pg101" id="Pg101" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> men in dazzling apparel”</span> say to the
        women, who stand with their faces bowed down towards the earth:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Why seek ye the living among the dead? He is
        not here, but he rose (οὐκ ἔστιν ὧδε, ἀλλὰ ἠγέρθη).<a id=

        Remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee, saying,
        that the Son of man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful
        men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.”</span> The
        complete change in the reference to Galilee here will be
        observed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The peculiar
        ending of the words of the <span class="tei tei-q">“young man”</span>
        in Peter is nowhere found in our Gospels: <span class="tei tei-q">“He
        is risen and gone away thither whence he was sent.”</span> Mr.
        Robinson compares with this a passage from the 20th Homily of
        Aphrahat (ed. Wright, p. 385): <span class="tei tei-q">“And the angel
        said to Mary, he is risen and gone away to him that sent him.”</span>
        Mr. Robinson adds: <span class="tei tei-q">“There is reason to
        believe that Aphrahat, a Syrian writer, used Tatian's Harmony: and
        thus we seem to have a second link between our Gospel and that
        important work.”</span><a id="noteref_118" name="noteref_118" href=
        "#note_118"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">118</span></span></a> But is
        it not rather a curious position in which to place the supposed
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Diatessaron,”</span> to argue that a passage
        which it does not now contain was nevertheless in it because a Syrian
        writer who is supposed to have used the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Diatessaron”</span> has quoted the passage? It shows how
        untrustworthy are all arguments regarding early works like the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Diatessaron.”</span> Looking at the other
        instances which could be pointed out, and to some of which we have
        referred, we see that everything not agreeing with the Gospels of the
        Church has been gradually eliminated or corrected into agreement, and
        that thus the very probable use of the Gospel according to Peter by
        Tatian may be concealed. As Mr. Robinson further points out,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page102">[pg 102]</span><a name="Pg102"
        id="Pg102" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> however, the words of the
        angel in Peter are in direct contradiction to those put into the
        mouth of Jesus in the fourth Gospel (xx. 17): <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I am not yet ascended to the Father.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The conclusion of
        the whole episode in Peter is the short and comprehensive phrase:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Then the women, frightened, fled”</span>
        (τότε αἱ γυναῖκες φοβηθεῖσαι ἔφυγον). In Matthew, in obedience to the
        order of the angel to go and tell his disciples, none of which is
        given in Peter, it is said (xxviii. 8): <span class="tei tei-q">“And
        they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy”</span>
        (καὶ ἀπελθοῦσαι ταχὺ ἀπὸ τοῦ μνημείου μετὰ φόβου καὶ χαρᾶς μεγάλης),
        <span class="tei tei-q">“and ran to bring his disciples word.”</span>
        In Mark (xvi. 8) it is said: <span class="tei tei-q">“And they went
        out and fled from the tomb; for trembling and astonishment had come
        upon them (καὶ ἐξελθοῦσαι ἔφυγον ἀπὸ τοῦ μνημείου; εἶκεν γὰρ αὐτὰς
        τρόμος καί ἔκστασις). And they said nothing to anyone: for they were
        afraid”</span> (ἐφοβοῦντο γάρ). The running to bring the disciples
        word, in the first, and the saying nothing to any one, of the second,
        Synoptic, is a case of curious contradiction in details. The third
        Gospel twice over repeats the statement that the women told what they
        had heard <span class="tei tei-q">“to the eleven and to all the
        rest”</span> (xxiv. 9, 10), but says nothing of the emotions excited
        by the interview, except the double statement (xxiv. 8), <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And they remembered his words,”</span> and, 11,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“And these words appeared in their sight as
        idle talk, and they disbelieved them.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the first
        Synoptic, however (xxviii. 9 f.), as the women go, the risen Jesus
        himself meets them and delivers the same order to tell the disciples
        to depart into Galilee, where they shall see him. The genuine portion
        of the second Synoptic ends with the words quoted above, and it is
        only in the added conclusion (xvi. 9. 20) that we meet with an
        account of an appearance <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page103">[pg
        103]</span><a name="Pg103" id="Pg103" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> to
        Mary Magdalene in the morning. The third Synoptic relates no
        appearance to the women or any one that morning; but the fourth
        Gospel has the appearance of Jesus to Mary Magdalene, and a long
        interview between them. Now all this is quite distinctly excluded
        from the Gospel according to Peter, and those who argue for the
        dependence of the work on our Gospels have to explain this deliberate
        omission.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And so, at a most
        interesting point, the fragment breaks off, in the middle of a
        phrase. This, it will be observed, distinctly excludes the vision to
        the two disciples in the country, mentioned Mark xvi. 12 f.,
        supposing it to be that described in the third Synoptic (xxiv. 13
        ff.), of which long narrative no hint is given in Peter. It also, of
        course, excludes the appearance to the disciples in the room,
        described in the fourth Gospel (xix. 20 ff.), and the breathing of
        the Holy Ghost upon them, of which very important episode the three
        Synoptics are equally ignorant, as well as the second appearance to
        them and the conviction of the unbelieving Thomas, which only this
        Gospel records. We may add that the appearance to the eleven as they
        sat at meat, related in the addition to the second Synoptic (xvi. 14
        f.), with the mission of the apostles <span class="tei tei-q">“into
        all the world,”</span> with miraculous powers endowed, which the
        other Gospels do not mention, is likewise excluded by
        Peter.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page104">[pg
        104]</span><a name="Pg104" id="Pg104" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is not all
        that is excluded, however, for in the fragment reference is
        distinctly made to the <span class="tei tei-q">“twelve
        disciples,”</span> which is an explicit confirmation of the statement
        made in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">v.</span></span> 26 f., <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I and my companions ... were fasting and
        mourning,”</span> which makes no exception any more than the similar
        <span class="tei tei-q">“We, the twelve disciples of the Lord”</span>
        now quoted. Supposing this statement to be deliberately made, and we
        have no reason whatever from anything in the rest of the fragment to
        doubt it, this completely excludes the whole of the story of a
        betrayal of his master by Judas Iscariot. Various facts must be
        remembered in confirmation of the view that the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“betrayal”</span> of Jesus by Judas Iscariot was unknown
        to the older tradition. In the Apocalypse (xxi. 14) it is said that
        upon the twelve foundations of the Holy City, the New Jerusalem, are
        written <span class="tei tei-q">“the twelve names of the twelve
        apostles of the Lamb.”</span> If, as is generally believed, this
        Apocalypse was written by John the Apostle, is it possible that, if
        Judas had betrayed his master in the manner described by the
        canonical Gospels, he could deliberately have written this, using
        twice over the <span class="tei tei-q">“twelve,”</span> which
        includes that Apostle? Again, in the first epistle to the Corinthians
        (i. xv. 5), in relating the supposed <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“appearances”</span> of Jesus, it is said that he first
        appeared to Cephas: <span class="tei tei-q">“Then unto the
        twelve.”</span><a id="noteref_119" name="noteref_119" href=
        "#note_119"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">119</span></span></a> If the
        point be considered on the mere ground of historical probability,
        there is every reason to consider that the betrayal by Judas is a
        later product of the <span class="tei tei-q">“evolved gnosis.”</span>
        Jesus is described as going about everywhere with his disciples, and
        nothing could <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page105">[pg
        105]</span><a name="Pg105" id="Pg105" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        have been easier, under the circumstances, than to follow and quietly
        arrest him, without any betrayal at all. In fact, there is no real
        need shown for such a betrayal, and the older Christian tradition
        probably did not contain it. It was just the trait which the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“evolved gnosis”</span> would add to the
        picture from such a passage as Psalm xli. 9: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which
        did eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me,”</span> and
        which was given its literal fulfilment in the detail mentioned in the
        first and second Synoptics (Matt. xxvi. 23, Mark. xiv. 20),
        <span class="tei tei-q">“He that dipped his hand with me in the dish,
        the same shall betray me.”</span> It may be mentioned that Justin
        does not appear to have known anything of a betrayal of Jesus, and
        that, in places where, if he had been aware of the episode, he would
        certainly have referred to it, he passes over it in total
        silence.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to the
        fragment, Simon Peter, and at least some of the disciples, must have
        gone into Galilee without any vision of the risen Jesus; and probably
        the last verse, which is broken off so abruptly, prepares the account
        of such an appearance as is described in the much-questioned last
        chapter of the fourth Gospel. It is worth pointing out, as perhaps an
        indication of the tradition which Peter follows, that both in the
        first and second Synoptic the order is given to the disciples to go
        into Galilee, where they are told that they are to see Jesus. In
        spite of this distinct order and statement, the author of the first
        Synoptic describes Jesus as immediately after appearing to the women,
        and giving the same direction to go into Galilee (xxviii. 7, 10),
        whilst in the spurious verses of Mark he nevertheless appears in
        Jerusalem to Mary Magdalene and to the Apostles. The third Synoptist
        gives a different turn to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page106">[pg
        106]</span><a name="Pg106" id="Pg106" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the
        mention of Galilee; but after the direction to go into Galilee, there
        to see Jesus, the visions described are a mere afterthought. In
        Peter, without any order, the disciples apparently go to Galilee, and
        there probably would be placed the first vision of the risen
        Jesus.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have now
        completed our comparison of the fragment with the canonical Gospels,
        and are able to form some opinion of its relative antiquity and
        relationship to our Gospels. Is it, as apologetic critics assert, a
        mere compilation from them, or can it take an independent position
        beside them, as a work derived from similar sources, and giving its
        own version of early Christian tradition? We have shown that it is
        not a compilation from our Gospels, but presents unmistakable signs
        of being an independent composition, and consequently a most
        interesting representation of Christian thought during the period
        when our Synoptic Gospels were likewise giving definite shape to the
        same traditions. Every part of this fragment has been set side by
        side with the corresponding narrative in the canonical Gospels, and
        it is simply surprising that a writing, dealing with a similar epoch
        of the same story, should have shown such freedom of handling. That
        there should be some correspondence between them was inevitable, but
        the wonder is not that there should be so much agreement, but so much
        divergence; and this wonder increases in proportion as a later date
        is assigned to the fragment, and the authority of the canonical
        Gospels had become more established.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The theory of
        <span class="tei tei-q">“tendency”</span> was sure to be advanced as
        an explanation of differences of treatment of the same story, but
        this seems to us much exaggerated in what <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page108">[pg 108]</span><a name="Pg108" id="Pg108" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> is said of the Gospel according to Peter. That
        early Docetic views might be supposed to be favoured by its
        representations is very possible; but these are far from being so
        pronounced as to render it unacceptable to those not holding such
        opinions, and the manner in which Justin and Origen make use of its
        statements is proof of this. As to its anti-Judaistic tone, a certain
        distinction has to be drawn. The expressions regarding <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the Jews,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“their
        feast”</span> (used in reference to the Passover), and so on, may be
        put in the same category as the definition of the veil of the Temple
        <span class="tei tei-q">“of Jerusalem,”</span> as indicating merely a
        work probably written out of Judaea, and for Gentile Christians; but
        in throwing upon the Jews, much more than on the Roman power, the
        odium of having crucified Jesus, the difference between Peter and the
        canonical Gospels is really infinitesimal. He certainly represents
        Pilate as retiring early from the trial, and leaving it to Herod, in
        whose <span class="tei tei-q">“jurisdiction”</span> it was, after
        washing his hands of the whole business; but this is a much more
        probable account, and perhaps an earlier tradition, than that which
        makes a Roman governor present the incredible and humiliating
        spectacle of a judge condemning and crucifying a man, in whom he
        finds no fault, at the dictation of a Jewish mob. The canonical
        Gospels, however, only accentuate the guilt of the Jews by
        representing the chief priests and elders, as well as the multitude,
        obstinately clamouring for his crucifixion, and finally overcoming
        Pilate's scruples. It is the chief priests and rulers who first seize
        Jesus and plot for his betrayal, who spit in his face, buffet and
        mock him, who prefer to him Barabbas, and cry: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“His blood be on us and on our children”</span> (Matt.
        xxvii. 25). The expressions of distinct antagonism to the Jews in the
        fourth Gospel far exceed any in the Gospel according <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page109">[pg 109]</span><a name="Pg109" id="Pg109"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> to Peter. There is, therefore, no
        preconceived purpose conceivable to account for the characteristics
        of the narrative in this fragment.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That a writer who
        had our canonical Gospels before him should so depart from their
        lines, alter every representation without dogmatic purpose, insert
        contradictory statements, and omit episodes of absorbing interest and
        passages which would have enriched his narrative, is a theory which
        cannot be established. It is obvious that the feeling of the writer
        is one of intense devotion and reverence, and it is unreasonable to
        suppose that he could have passed over, altered, and contradicted so
        many points in the narrative of the Gospels, had he had those works
        before him.<a id="noteref_120" name="noteref_120" href=
        "#note_120"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">120</span></span></a> In all
        probability he composed his work from earlier records and traditions,
        of the existence of which we have evidence in Luke i. 1, and the
        degree of resemblance on the one hand, and of discrepancy on the
        other, proceeds from independent use of these sources, from which the
        materials used in the canonical Gospels may have been drawn. It had
        not the good fortune of these Gospels, however, to be adopted by the
        Church and subjected, like them, to repeated revisal; but, drifting
        apart on the stream of time, it at last comes to us with all its
        original sins and imperfections on its head. Of course, any judgment
        now formed on the Gospel according to Peter is subject to the
        unfortunate limitation that we have only a fragment of the work in
        our hands; but should the rest be discovered, as we hope, it will not
        affect conclusions now based upon the part before us, whatever may be
        the final verdict on the whole.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have still to
        consider objections raised by Mr. Rendel Harris, however, concerning
        the relation between this fragment and the Gospels accepted by the
        Church. In a long article in the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Contemporary Review”</span> he tries to establish the
        thesis that <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">The Gospel of Peter
        shows everywhere the traces of a highly evolved prophetic gnosis, and

        would not be possible, without wearying the most patient of
        parishioners, to illustrate in any adequate manner the perverse and
        hair-splitting ingenuity with which the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“highly evolved prophetic gnosis”</span> went to work,
        and which, in very parlous fashion, Mr. Harris applies to Peter; but,
        fortunately, this will not be necessary here. This gnosis doubtless
        began its operation early, and reached a climax towards the fourth
        century; but then it had ceased to be creative, and had become wildly
        analytical. Nothing then remained for it to do. Mr. Rendel Harris
        quotes, with admirable courage, a <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“significant sentence”</span> from the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Peregrinatio ad Loca Sancta,”</span> a work of St.
        Sylvia of Aquitaine, or some other lady traveller of the fourth
        century, which has recently been published. She has been relating how
        the people were instructed in the mysteries of the faith by readings
        from the Scriptures, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
        xml:lang="la"><span style=

        "tei tei-anchor"></a> passages from the Acts and Epistles which bear
        upon the interpretation of such predictions; further, the evidence of
        the prophets; and, to crown all, the story of the Passion itself from
        the Gospels. <span class="tei tei-q">“The object of this service was,
        as Sylvia points out, that the people might understand by the Gospel
        record that whatever the psalmists and prophets had foretold
        concerning the Passion of the Lord had actually taken place.”</span>
        And now comes the <span class="tei tei-q">“significant
        sentence”</span> to which we referred above, italicised by Mr. Harris
        himself: <span class="tei tei-q">“And so for the space of three hours
        the people is taught that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        frankly admitting the application of this fundamental principle of
        the prophetic gnosis, more or less throughout all early Christian
        literature, Mr. Harris wishes to limit its influence upon works
        received into the canon, into which the two-edged weapon, however,
        pierces in spite of him to the sundering apart of soul and body. He
        says:</p>

        like, we shall find that there never was a body of history which was
        so overgrown with legend, and the major part of these legends result
        from the irregular study of the Old Testament, probably based on the
        synagogue methods of the time of the early Christian teachers. This
        reaction of the prophecy upon history colours the style of authors

        object here, of course, is to lay the basis of an indictment against

        is enunciated, the application of which cannot be directed as the
        writer pleases, but is apt to be as deadly to friends as to foes. Mr.
        Harris may attempt to satisfy his doubts, in writing with the
        impartiality of a scholar, as he does, with the reservation that
        <span class="tei tei-q">“no history is, in its ultimate analysis, so
        trustworthy as Christian history,”</span> but he has only to
        formulate the reasons for such a statement, to recognise their utter
        inadequacy. In so far as he gives us any glimpse of them here, they
        are of sad insufficiency. He speaks, a little further on, regarding
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the real need of a critical method that can
        distinguish between statements that are genuine history, and
        statements that are prophetic reflexes. For this

        Harris goes on to affirm that the measure of this encroachment is, in
        the first two centuries, one of the best indications of documentary
        date we possess: <span class="tei tei-q">“As a test, it will settle
        the period of many a document, and perhaps the measure of the appeal
        to prophecy will even determine the chronological order of the
        Gospels themselves: Mark, Luke, John, and Matthew.”</span><a id=

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        order will probably surprise a good many readers, and shake the faith
        they might perhaps be disposed to repose in the test which is
        supposed to have decided it. Mr. Harris applies the test in various
        instances to Peter, and we shall briefly examine his results.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It will be
        remembered that in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">v.</span></span> 35 f. whilst the soldiers were
        keeping watch over the sepulchre, there was a great voice in the
        heavens, and they saw the heavens opened, and <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“two men”</span> (δύο ἄνδρας) came down from thence with
        great light, and approach the tomb, and the stone which had been laid
        at the door rolled away, and they entered it, but presently they
        beheld again three men (τρεῖς ἄνδρας) coming out, and the two were
        supporting or conducting the other by the hand, and the lofty stature
        of the three is described. Now the <span class="tei tei-q">“highly
        evolved prophetic gnosis”</span> by which, according to Mr. Harris,
        this representation was composed is as follows, though only the main
        lines of the painful process can be given. In the prayer of Habakkuk
        (iii. 2), according to the Septuagint, the words which stand in our
        Bible, <span class="tei tei-q">“In the midst of the years make
        known”</span> reads: <span class="tei tei-q">“In the midst of
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">two
        lives</span></em>”</span> (or of <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">two living
        creatures</span></em>) <span class="tei tei-q">“thou shalt be
        known.”</span> This is referred in two ways: to <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Christ's incarnation”</span> and to his <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Death and Resurrection.”</span> In the former case the
        two animals are the ox and the ass at the Nativity. The
        interpretation in the second case: the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page114">[pg 114]</span><a name="Pg114" id="Pg114" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“living
        creatures”</span> are the seraphim, two in number, because in Isaiah
        (vi. 3) <span class="tei tei-q">“one called to the other and
        said:”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“and we have only to find a
        situation in which Christ is seen between two angels, and the
        prophecy is fulfilled. This situation is made in the Gospel of Peter
        by Christ rising between two supporting angels.”</span> Mr. Harris
        endeavours to strengthen this by referring to Cyril of Alexandria's
        comment on the two living creatures (in the fourth century). Cyril is
        in doubt whether the two living creatures are the Father and the Holy
        Spirit, or the Old and New Testament, but recurs to the earlier
        interpretation that they are the Cherubim. Mr. Harris also cites the
        Targum of Jonathan Ben Uzziel on Zechariah iii. 7: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“If thou wilt keep the observation of my word, <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">I will raise thee up
        in the resurrection of the dead, and set thy feet walking between the
        two cherubim</span></em>.”</span> Then, as soon as this
        identification of the two living creatures had been made, it was
        easy, says Mr. Harris, to pass over to the ninety-ninth Psalm, which
        Justin<a id="noteref_126" name="noteref_126" href=
        "#note_126"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">126</span></span></a> affirms
        to be a prediction of Christ.</p>

        Christ, and, perhaps to the quaking of the earth. Nor is it without

        to come forth as a bridegroom from his chamber, and to rejoice</span>
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In order to be as
        just as possible, all this has been given in greater detail than
        perhaps the case deserves. It seems rather a heavy avalanche of
        conjecture to bring down upon Peter, who simply narrates, without the
        most distant reference to any prophetic texts; and <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page115">[pg 115]</span><a name="Pg115" id="Pg115"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> it is perhaps a little hard that Justin,
        who in all probability had the Gospel already written and before him,
        should contribute in this casual way to the author's discomfiture.
        However, let us see what there is to be said upon the other side. The
        first general remark that may be made is, that it can scarcely be
        considered evidence of the later date of Peter to ascribe to him, as
        the source of this detail, an elaborate twisting of texts through the
        operation of gnosis, which has not been proved to have existed in
        this form before the epoch at which he wrote. This is said without
        any intention of casting doubt on the general operation of supposed
        prophetic passages on the evolution of Gospel history, but merely as
        questioning this particular explanation of the mode in which this
        representation was originally suggested, and more especially for the
        purpose of adding that, whatever reproach of this kind is cast upon
        the Gospel according to Peter, must equally be directed against the
        canonical gospels.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It will be
        remembered that, in the third Synoptic, <span class="tei tei-q">“two
        men in shining apparel”</span> assist at the resurrection, and that
        in the fourth Gospel Mary sees in the tomb <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, the
        other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.”</span> Here
        there is an occasion for applying with equal—or, as we shall
        presently see, greater—propriety the argument of <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“highly evolved prophetic gnosis”</span> to the writers,
        and so explaining their representation. But there is more to be
        suggested in connection with the matter. In the first and second
        Synoptics, only one angel assists at the scene, who in the second
        Synoptic is called <span class="tei tei-q">“a young man”</span>
        (νεανίσκος). Now the <span class="tei tei-q">“two men”</span> of
        great stature in Peter only go into the tomb and come out again with
        Jesus; but subsequently the heavens were again opened (<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">v.</span></span> 44),
        and a certain man descends and <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page116">[pg 116]</span><a name="Pg116" id="Pg116" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> goes into the tomb and remains there, for when
        the women come (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">v.</span></span> 55) they see there <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“a certain young man”</span> (νεανίσκος) <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“sitting in the midst of the tomb, beautiful and clad in
        a shining garment,”</span> who speaks to them as in the two
        Synoptics, and tells them that <span class="tei tei-q">“Jesus is gone
        thither whence he was sent.”</span> This, then, is the angel who
        appears in Matthew and Mark. We have already mentioned that the two
        men of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">v.</span></span> 36 have been identified by some
        critics as Moses and Elias. The account of the transfiguration is
        given in all the Synoptics, though it does not seem to have been
        known to the author of the fourth Gospel—although <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“John”</span> was an actor in the scene—but that in the
        third Synoptic is fuller than the rest (ix. 28 ff). Jesus takes with
        him Peter and John and James, and goes up into the mountain to pray;
        and as he prays his countenance was altered, and his raiment becomes
        white and dazzling; <span class="tei tei-q">“and behold there talked
        with him two men (ἄνδρες δύο), which were Moses and Elijah; who
        appeared in glory, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">and spake of his decease which he was about to
        accomplish at Jerusalem</span></em>.”</span> When Peter and the
        others were fully awake, <span class="tei tei-q">“they saw his glory
        and the two men (δύο ἄνδρας) that stood with him. And it came to
        pass, as they were parting from him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master,
        it is good for us to be here; and let us make three tabernacles; one
        for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah: <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not knowing what he
        said</span></em>. And while he said these things there came a cloud,
        and overshadowed them ... and a voice came out of the cloud, saying,
        This is my son, my chosen: hear ye him.”</span> To this episode Mr.
        Harris might reasonably apply the test of the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“highly evolved prophetic gnosis;”</span> but in any
        case, the view that the two men of the fragment are intended to
        represent Moses and Elijah—the law and the prophets—who had so short
        a time before <span class="tei tei-q">“spoken of <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page117">[pg 117]</span><a name="Pg117" id="Pg117"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> his decease which he was about to
        accomplish in Jerusalem,”</span> and who now came, in stature
        reaching to the heavens, but less than his which rose above the
        heavens, and conducted Jesus the Christ forth from the tomb, in which
        that decease had been fulfilled, is in the highest degree probable.
        Much more might be said regarding this, but too much time has already
        been devoted to the point.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The second
        application of Mr. Harris's test is to the sealing of the stone at
        the sepulchre with seven seals. The Gospel of Peter simply states
        that the stone was sealed with seven seals, and Mr. Harris endeavours
        to find some abstruse meaning in the statement, which is peculiar to
        the fragment in so far as the number of seals is concerned. Where did
        Peter get the idea? Mr. Harris says, first from Zechariah iii. 9:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“For behold the stone that I have set before
        Joshua; upon one stone are seven eyes; behold I will engrave the
        graving thereof, saith the Lord of hosts;”</span> and the name Joshua
        is the Hebrew equivalent of Jesus. A reference is also made by the
        Fathers of the second century to passages to prove that Christ was
        the stone (of stumbling to the Jews, but the corner stone to
        believers). <span class="tei tei-q">“Justin recognised Christ in the
        stone cut out without hands, of which Daniel speaks; in the stone
        which Jacob set for his pillow, and which he anointed with oil; in
        the stone on which Moses sat in the battle with Amalek,”</span> and
        the like. <span class="tei tei-q">“Bearing in mind that there was an
        early tendency to connect the language of the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘Branch’</span> passage with the resurrection, we can see
        that the interpretation took a second form, viz. to regard the stone
        before the face of Jesus as a prophecy of the stone which closed the
        tomb in the evangelic story.”</span> There is evidence, Mr. Harris
        says, that the seven eyes were early interpreted by Biblical
        Targumists to mean seven seals.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page118">[pg 118]</span><a name="Pg118" id="Pg118" class=

        <span style="font-size: 90%">We need not be surprised, then, that the
        Peter Gospel speaks of the stone as sealed with seven seals; it is an
        attempt to throw the story into closer parallelism with Zechariah, no
        doubt for polemic purposes against the Jews. That he uses the curious
        word ἐπέχρισαν, which we are obliged, from the exigencies of

        "font-size: 90%">”</span></span> <span style="font-size: 90%">is due
        to the lurking desire to make a parallel with Christ and the stone

          answer is found in the pages of the Peter Gospel:</span>
          <span class="tei tei-q"><span style=
          "font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">a great crowd

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now again the
        general remark has to be made that, in order to convict Peter of a
        late date, Mr. Harris takes all this <span class="tei tei-q">“highly
        evolved gnosis”</span> wherever he can find it, without consideration
        of epochs, and in some parts upon mere personal conjecture. He even
        confesses that he does not know the date of the translation of
        Symmachus, which he nevertheless uses as an argument. He observes,
        himself, that it is <span class="tei tei-q">“a little awkward”</span>
        that the stone, which at one time represents Jesus, has to be treated
        in the same breath as before the face of Jesus. The terribly
        complicated and involved process, by which it is suggested that the
        author of the Gospel according to Peter evolved a detail so
        apparently simple <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page119">[pg
        119]</span><a name="Pg119" id="Pg119" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> as
        the sealing of the sepulchre with seven seals, is difficult enough to
        follow, and must have been still more difficult to invent, but in his
        anxiety to assign a late date to the fragment, Mr. Harris forgets
        that, if the number seven is evidence of it, a large part of the New
        Testament must be moved back with the fragment. The Synoptics are
        full of it,<a id="noteref_129" name="noteref_129" href=
        "#note_129"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">129</span></span></a> but it
        is quite sufficient to point to the Apocalypse, which has this
        typical number in almost every chapter: the message to the seven
        churches; the seven spirits before the throne; the seven golden
        candlesticks; the seven stars; seven lamps of fire burning; seven
        angels; seven trumpets; seven thunders; the dragon with seven heads,
        and seven diadems; the seven angels with seven plagues; the woman
        with seven heads, and so on. The most striking and apposite instance,
        which Mr. Harris indeed does not pass over, but mentions as having
        <span class="tei tei-q">“a curious and suggestive connection”</span>

        though it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which
        are seven spirits of God, which is found worthy to take the book and
        open the seals.<a id="noteref_131" name="noteref_131" href=

        of giving the author of the fragment, who does not make the slightest
        claim to it, credit for so extraordinary a feat of synthetic
        exegesis, is it not more simple and probable that he used the number
        seven as a mere ordinary symbol of completeness? but if more than
        this be deemed requisite, and the detail has a deeper mystical sense,
        he can only be accused of <span class="tei tei-q">“highly evolved
        prophetic gnosis,”</span> in company with the author of the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page120">[pg 120]</span><a name="Pg120"
        id="Pg120" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Apocalypse and other canonical
        books, and this still gives him a position in the same epoch with
        them, more than which, probably, no one demands.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another instance
        may be rapidly disposed of. The writer of Peter, Mr. Harris affirms,
        was not ignorant of the gnosis of the Cross wrought out by the
        Fathers from the Old Testament, on the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Wood”</span> and the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Tree.”</span> One passage at which they laboured heavily
        is in Habakkuk ii. 11: <span class="tei tei-q">“The stone cries out
        of the wall, and the cross-beam answers back to it.”</span> Mr.
        Harris proceeds:</p>

        <div class="block tei tei-quote" style=
        "margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">
        <span style="font-size: 90%">Now the author of the Peter Gospel has
        been at work on the passage; he wishes to make the cross talk, and
        not only talk, but answer back; accordingly, he introduces a
        question:</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style=
        "font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Hast thou
        preached to them that are asleep?</span><span style=
        "font-size: 90%">”</span></span> <span style="font-size: 90%">and the
        response is heard from the cross,</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style=
        "font-size: 90%">Yea.</span><span style=
        "font-size: 90%">”</span></span> <span style="font-size: 90%">As far
        as I can suspect, the first speaker is Christ, the Stone; and the
        answer comes from the Cross, the Wood. It is then the Cross that has
        descended into Hades. But perhaps this is pressing the writer's words
        a little too far.</span><a id="noteref_132" name="noteref_132"
          href="#note_132"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">132</span></span></a>
        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Is it not also
        pressing the writer's thoughts a little too far to suggest such
        trains of childish interpretation as the origin of all his
        characteristic representations? Mr. Harris, by way of bringing the
        charge nearer to Peter, says that the passage of Habakkuk
        <span class="tei tei-q">“is quoted by Barnabas, though no doubt from
        a corrupted text, with a positive assertion that the Cross is here
        intimated by the prophet.”</span><a id="noteref_133" name=
        "noteref_133" href="#note_133"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">133</span></span></a> This is
        not so. The passage in Barnabas (xii.) reads: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“He defineth concerning the Cross in another prophet, who
        saith: <span class="tei tei-q">‘And when shall these things be
        accomplished? saith the Lord. Whensoever a tree shall be bended and
        stand upright, and whensoever blood shall drop from a tree.’</span>
        Again thou art taught concerning the cross and him that was to be
        crucified.”</span> This is not a quotation from Habakkuk,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page121">[pg 121]</span><a name="Pg121"
        id="Pg121" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> but from 4 Esdras v. 5. This
        is, however, not of much importance. It is of greater moment to
        observe that Mr. Harris, in applying this test, is only able to
        <span class="tei tei-q">“suspect”</span> that, in this episode in
        Peter, the speaker who asks the question is Christ the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“stone,”</span> and the answer from the cross, the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“wood;”</span> but as the first <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“speaker”</span> is a voice <span class="tei tei-q">“out
        of the heavens,”</span> it is difficult to connect it with
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Christ the Stone,”</span> to whom the
        question is actually addressed. According to this, he puts the
        question to himself. Such exegesis, applied to almost any conceivable
        statement, might prove almost any conceivable hypothesis.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next instance
        requires us to turn to a passage in Amos (viii. 9-10, LXX):
        <span class="tei tei-q">“And it shall come to pass in that day, saith
        the Lord God, that the sun shall set at midday, ... and I will turn
        your feasts into wailing and all your songs to lamentation, and I
        will lay sackcloth on all loins, and baldness on every head; and I
        will set him as the wailing for the beloved, and those that are with
        him as a day of grief.”</span> With it, we are told, must be taken
        the parallel verse in which Zechariah (xiv. 6, 7) predicts a day in
        which <span class="tei tei-q">“there shall be no light, but cold and
        frost ... but towards evening there shall be light.”</span> This was
        one of the proofs with early Christians of the events which happened
        at the crucifixion, and St. Cyprian, for instance, quotes it. It is
        also quoted in the sixth Homily of the Persian Father Aphrahat
        against the Jews. <span class="tei tei-q">“The Gospel of Peter did
        not apparently possess the gnosis in such a highly evolved form as
        this,”</span> but works on the same lines. Mr. Harris then quotes
        passages from the fragment, which we shall give after him, with his
        inserted comments, but as he does not mark the intervals which occur
        between them, we shall take the liberty of inserting <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page122">[pg 122]</span><a name="Pg122" id="Pg122"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the verses from which they are taken
        between brackets.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 0.90em"><span style=
          "font-size: 90%">The writer is, therefore, drawing on the details
          of prophecy, as suggested by the current testimonies against the
          Jews, and most likely on a written gnosis involving these
          testimonies. That he veils his sources simply shows that he is not
          one of the first brood of anti-Jewish preachers. If he had been
          early, he would not have been artificial or occult.</span><a id=
          "noteref_135" name="noteref_135" href="#note_135"><span class=

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now, as before,
        Mr. Harris uses the eccentricities of a gnosis which he does not
        prove to have existed at the time the fragment may have been written
        and, for instance, he quotes St. Cyprian, who wrote in the second
        half of the third century, and the Persian Father Aphrahat, also a
        writer long after the Gospel of Peter was composed, and his remark
        that the writer <span class="tei tei-q">“did not apparently possess
        the gnosis in so highly evolved a form”</span> as Aphrahat, is not so
        much an admission in his favour as to prepare the reader to be
        content with inferior evidence. The test, however, quite as much
        applies to our Gospels as to the Gospel of Peter. In the previous
        working, of which the fragment says nothing, those who pass
        <span class="tei tei-q">“wag their heads”</span> and rail, in each of
        the Synoptics, in a jubilant way. The first Synoptic says (xxvii. 45
        f.) <span class="tei tei-q">“Now from the sixth hour there was
        darkness over all the land until the ninth <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page123">[pg 123]</span><a name="Pg123" id="Pg123" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> hour.”</span> The centurion and those who were
        watching <span class="tei tei-q">“feared exceedingly.”</span> In Mark
        (xv. 33) there also <span class="tei tei-q">“was darkness over the
        whole earth until the ninth hour,”</span> but in Luke (xxiii. 44 f.)
        the resemblance is still more marked. The darkness comes over the
        whole earth from the sixth until the ninth hour, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the sun's light failing.”</span> (48) <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And all the multitudes that came together to this sight,
        when they beheld the things that were done, <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">returned smiting
        their breasts</span></em>.”</span> In the fourth Gospel (xx. 11),
        Mary goes to the tomb weeping. We shall have more to say regarding
        the Gospels presently, but here we need only remark that, whether in
        exactly the same way or not, the <span class="tei tei-q">“highly
        evolved prophetic gnosis”</span> has certainly done its work in all
        of them. In this respect, the Gospel of Peter merely takes its place
        with the rest.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is only one
        other instance to be noticed here. It refers to some of the details
        which the writer of the fragment introduces into the mockery which
        precedes the crucifixion. Some of the mockers <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“prick”</span> Jesus with a reed; others spat on his
        eyes. This, Mr. Harris says, is connected with a view early taken
        regarding a change of Jewish feasts. In the Epistle of Barnabas,
        there is the best exposition of the doctrine that the Feast should be
        turned into mourning and the Passover at which Jesus suffered should
        be treated as if it had been the Day of Atonement. In Barnabas, the
        ritual of the great day is discussed in detail, and the rules of
        procedure for the Priests and the People, apparently taken, Mr.
        Harris thinks, from a Greek handbook, prove a variety of local usage
        such as would not have been suspected from the Scripture, read apart
        from the rest of the literature of the time. The <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“unwashed inwards”</span> of one goat, offered at the
        fast for all sins, are to be eaten by the priests alone, with
        vinegar, while the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page124">[pg
        124]</span><a name="Pg124" id="Pg124" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        people fast and wail in sackcloth and ashes. This goat is one of two
        over which lot is cast on the Day of Atonement; the other is the
        scape-goat, Azazel, which, according to Barnabas, was to be treated
        with contumely, and sent away into the wilderness: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“All of you spit on him, and prick him, and put the
        scarlet wool on his head,”</span> &amp;c. Now the two goats both
        represent Christ, according to Barnabas, <span class="tei tei-q">“who
        twists these written regulations into prophecies of the first and
        second Advents, and of the details of the Passion.”</span></p>

        <div class="block tei tei-quote" style=
        "margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">
        <span style="font-size: 90%">The mention of vinegar to be eaten with
        the bitter portion of the goat, suggested the words of the
        Psalm:</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style=
        "font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">Gall for my
        meat and vinegar for my drink;</span><span style=
        "font-size: 90%">”</span></span> <span style="font-size: 90%">the
        command to spit on the goat and prick (or pierce) him [which
        ill-usage, by the way, the Talmud admits to have been the practice of
        the Alexandrian Jews], is interpreted by Barnabas to be a type or a
        prophecy of Christ</span> <span class="tei tei-q"><span style=
        "font-size: 90%">“</span><span style="font-size: 90%">set at naught
        and pierced and spat on.</span><span style=
        "font-size: 90%">”</span></span> <span style="font-size: 90%">Is
        there any trace of the gnosis of the two goats in Peter? If we may
        judge from the conjunction of the words in the account of the
        Mockery, there is a decided trace:</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q"><span style="font-size: 90%">“</span><span style=
        "font-size: 90%">Others stood and spat on his eyes ... others pricked
        him with a reed;</span><span style="font-size: 90%">”</span></span>
        <span style="font-size: 90%">it is Christ as the goat Azazel.</span>
        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mr. Harris quotes
        <span class="tei tei-q">“an almost contemporary Sibyllist,”</span>
        <span class="tei tei-q">“They shall prick his side with a reed,
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">according
        to their law</span></em>;”</span> and he continues: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“If the Sybillist is quoting Peter, he is also
        interpreting him, and his interpretation is, they shall prick him, as
        is done to the goat Azazel.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To make Peter
        responsible for the ideas or interpretations of the Sybillist is a
        little hard. However, let us examine this matter. It is to be
        observed that the only innovation in Peter, regarding the spitting,
        is the expression that they <span class="tei tei-q">“spat upon
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">his
        eyes</span></em>”</span> instead of simply <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“upon him,”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“in his
        face,”</span> as in the Gospels; but upon this nothing turns. The
        point is not even mentioned; so it may be dismissed. Regarding the
        reed, Peter says they <span class="tei tei-q">“pierced”</span> him
        with it, instead of <span class="tei tei-q">“smote him”</span> with
        it. Let us leave the <span class="tei tei-q">“piercing”</span> aside
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page125">[pg 125]</span><a name="Pg125"
        id="Pg125" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> for the moment. In all other
        respects, the contumely is the same in the Gospels. Before the high
        priest, in Matthew and Mark (Matt. xxvi. 67, Mark xiv. 65), they spit
        in his face and buffet him, and smite him with the palms of their
        hands; and in Luke (xxii. 63 f.) they mock and beat him and revile
        him. It is curious that, according to the second Synoptist, all this
        was foretold, for he makes Jesus say (x. 33 f.): <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall
        be delivered unto the chief priests and the scribes: and they shall
        condemn him to death, and shall deliver him unto the Gentiles: and
        they shall mock him, and shall spit upon him, and shall scourge him,
        and shall kill him, and after three days he shall rise again.”</span>
        After the trial before Pilate, in Mark (xv. 17 ff.), they put on him
        a purple robe, and the crown of thorns on his head, and a reed in his
        hand, and spit upon him, and take the reed and smite him on the head.
        In Peter, likewise, they clothe him in purple, put on his head the
        crown of thorns, spit upon his eyes, smite him on the cheeks, and
        pierce him with a reed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What difference is
        there here except the mere piercing? Yes! there is a difference, for
        Mr. Harris has forgotten to refer to the scarlet wool put on the goat
        Azazel. There is nothing in Peter which corresponds with the scarlet
        wool. The robe that is put upon Jesus is purple. Now Barnabas, in the
        chapter from which Mr. Harris quotes all these passages, finds this
        point of the <span class="tei tei-q">“scarlet wool”</span> fulfilled
        in Jesus: <span class="tei tei-q">“For they shall see him in that day
        wearing the long scarlet robe about his flesh.”</span><a id=
        "noteref_136" name="noteref_136" href="#note_136"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">136</span></span></a> But if
        we look in the first Synoptic we also find this, for we read (xxvii.
        28): <span class="tei tei-q">“And they stripped him, and put on him a
        scarlet robe”</span> (χλαμύδα κοκκίνην). The mere detail of piercing
        with <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page126">[pg 126]</span><a name=
        "Pg126" id="Pg126" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the reed instead of
        smiting with it is trifling compared with this, and in all essential
        points Mr. Harris's test more fitly applies to the first Synoptic
        than to Peter, and equally so to the other two.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As for the
        piercing with the reed, however, we have only to turn to the fourth
        Gospel, and we find its counterpart (xix. 34) where one of the
        soldiers with a spear pierced the side of Jesus. Why? (36)
        <span class="tei tei-q">“That the Scripture might be fulfilled....
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘They shall look on him whom they
        pierced.’</span> ”</span> Here is the <span class="tei tei-q">“highly
        evolved prophetic gnosis”</span> without any disguise. If one writer
        prefer to fulfil one part of Scripture, the other may select another
        without much difference in standing. Even Mr. Harris admits that
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the gnosis on which Barnabas works is
        ultimately based on the same passage”</span> as that quoted as
        fulfilled in the fourth Gospel<a id="noteref_137" name="noteref_137"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have now
        discussed practically all the test instances advanced by Mr. Rendel
        Harris, and the result at which we arrive is, that he has not
        succeeded in proving that the Gospel of Peter betrays such traces of
        a <span class="tei tei-q">“highly evolved prophetic gnosis”</span> as
        require us to assign to it a later date than the canonical Gospels.
        If this system of elaborate and perverted ingenuity were applied to
        these Gospels, as it has been to the fragment, and every kind of
        false exegesis, childish reasoning, and wild interpretation, such as
        was current amongst the Fathers, brought forward to explain the
        construction of the four canonical works, the consequence would be
        terribly surprising to pious readers. That this exegesis began early
        is quite undeniable, and it is not too much to say that it is
        palpably visible on the very surface of most of the books of the New
        Testament. It had, as Mr. Harris must admit and does admit, practical
        effect on the composition of the Gospels as they have come down to
        us, but it is fully displayed in some of the Epistles of Paul, still
        more in those passing under his name, is supreme in the Epistle to
        the Hebrews, and as for the Acts, the Apostles are, from the very
        opening, made to express the highly evolved prophetic gnosis of the
        author. We do not, of course, argue that the writer of the fragment
        is free from it, but merely that he shares it equally with the other
        Evangelists, however much their canonicity, <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page128">[pg 128]</span><a name="Pg128" id="Pg128" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> derived from the very Fathers who are steeped
        in this gnosis, may protect them from Mr. Harris's dangerous attack.
        Without going into an explanation of the genesis of various important
        points in the story, which would require a volume, we may just glance
        at some of the points at which the Evangelists frankly declare the
        source of the gnosis, and allow the process to be seen.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Let us take for
        instance the first Synoptic. The events previous to the birth of
        Jesus (i. 18 if.) take place <span class="tei tei-q">“that it might
        be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet,
        saying, Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth
        a son, And they shall call his name Immanuel,”</span> and it is only
        an illustration of the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">naïveté</span></span> of the period that two
        verses further on they call the son, not Immanuel, but Jesus. The
        chief priests and scribes inform Herod (ii. 5 f.) that the Christ
        should be born in Bethlehem of Judaea, because it was written by the
        prophet: <span class="tei tei-q">“And thou Bethlehem, land of Judah,
        Art in no wise least among the princes of Judah: For out of thee
        shall come forth a governor, Which shall be shepherd of my people
        Israel.”</span> Joseph takes the young child and his mother into
        Egypt (ii. 15 f.), <span class="tei tei-q">“that it might be
        fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,
        Out of Egypt did I call my son.”</span> Herod slays all the male
        children in Bethlehem and in all the borders thereof (ii. 16 f.) and
        <span class="tei tei-q">“then was fulfilled that which was spoken
        through Jeremiah the prophet, saying, A voice was heard in Ramah,
        Weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children,”</span>
        &amp;c. On returning from Egypt they settle in Galilee, in a city
        called Nazareth (ii. 23), <span class="tei tei-q">“that it might be
        fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, that he should be called
        a Nazarene.”</span> John the Baptist comes preaching <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“in the wilderness”</span> (iii. 1 f.), <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“for this is he that was spoken of by Isaiah <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page129">[pg 129]</span><a name="Pg129" id="Pg129"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the prophet, saying, The voice of one
        crying in the wilderness,”</span> &amp;c. The temptation of Jesus in
        the wilderness is based upon three texts: (iv. 1 ff.) <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Man shall not live by bread alone,”</span> &amp;c.;
        <span class="tei tei-q">“He shall give his angels charge concerning
        thee,”</span> &amp;c., and <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou shalt
        worship the Lord thy God,”</span> &amp;c. When John is delivered up
        (iv. 12 ff.) Jesus leaves Nazareth and dwells <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the borders of
        Zebulun and Naphtali: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by
        Isaiah the prophet, saying, The land of Zebulun and the land of
        Naphtali, toward the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles, the
        people which sat in darkness saw a great light, and to them which sat
        in the region and shadow of death, to them did light spring
        up.”</span> In the episode of John in prison sending his disciples to
        Jesus (xi. 2 ff.), the whole reply is based indirectly on prophetic
        gnosis, and the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">v.</span></span> 10 directly: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my
        messenger before thy face, Who shall prepare thy way before
        thee,”</span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">v.</span></span> 14, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And if ye are willing to receive it, this is Elijah,
        which is to come.”</span> When the Pharisees take counsel to destroy
        him (xii. 14 f.), and Jesus withdraws, healing the sick and enjoining
        them that they should not make him known, it is <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah
        the prophet, saying, Behold my servant,”</span> &amp;c. There is an
        exhibition of <span class="tei tei-q">“highly evolved prophetic
        gnosis”</span> (xii. 39 ff.) when a sign is asked for, and the sign
        of Jonah the prophet is given, <span class="tei tei-q">“for as Jonah
        was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale, so shall
        the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the
        earth,”</span> a gnosis which helped to shape the representation of
        the entombment. The speaking in parables is justified, not originated
        (xiii. 14 f.), as a fulfilment of the prophecy of Isaiah,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“By hearing ye shall hear, and <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page130">[pg 130]</span><a name="Pg130" id="Pg130"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> shall in no wise understand,”</span>
        &amp;c, and (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">v.</span></span> 35) <span class="tei tei-q">“I
        will open my mouth in parables,”</span> &amp;c. Of course, as Mr.
        Harris says, <span class="tei tei-q">“no sane person would take St.
        Matthew's quotation as the cause of the Sermon on the Mount, or the
        parabolic discourse;”</span><a id="noteref_138" name="noteref_138"
        href="#note_138"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">138</span></span></a> but, as
        he admits, the prophetic passages were in the author's mind, and are
        amongst <span class="tei tei-q">“the first faint shadows cast by the
        prophecy [?] upon the history,”</span> and they certainly led to the
        representation that those who heard the parabolic teaching, and
        notably the disciples, did not understand the most luminous
        discourses, and required a private explanation of the clearest
        allegories. The entry into Jerusalem (xxi. 2 f.) is arranged
        <span class="tei tei-q">“that it might be fulfilled which was spoken
        by the prophet, saying, Tell ye the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy
        King cometh unto thee, meek, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt
        the foal of an ass;”</span> and the writer, not appreciating the
        duplication of Hebrew poetry, is literal enough to relate
        (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">v.</span></span> 2) that Jesus tells the
        disciples they shall find <span class="tei tei-q">“an ass tied, and a
        colt with her,”</span> which they are to bring, and (<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">v.</span></span> 7)
        <span class="tei tei-q">“they brought the ass and the colt, and put
        on them their garments; <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">and he sat upon them</span></em>”</span> (ἐπάνω
        αὐτῶν): a representation which has ever since given much trouble to
        pious commentators. It is not difficult to see that the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“cleansing of the temple”</span> (xxi. 12 f.) takes place
        because <span class="tei tei-q">“it is written, My house shall be
        called a house of prayer, but ye make it a den of robbers.”</span>
        The trials when <span class="tei tei-q">“the abomination of
        desolation (xxiv. 16 f.), which was spoken of by Daniel the
        prophet,”</span> is seen <span class="tei tei-q">“standing in the
        holy place (<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">let him that readeth
        understand</span></em>),”</span> is an example of the prophetic
        gnosis. The preparation for the passion commences (xxvi. 2),
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Ye know that after two days the passover
        cometh, and the Son of man is delivered <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page131">[pg 131]</span><a name="Pg131" id="Pg131" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> up to be crucified.”</span> Jesus is
        represented (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">v.</span></span> 31) as saying to the disciples:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“All ye shall be offended in me this night:
        for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the
        flock shall be scattered abroad;”</span> and the curious phrase which
        follows is worth consideration: <span class="tei tei-q">“But after I
        am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee,”</span> which seems
        to have slipped in here out of its place. The events which take place
        at the arrest, and their coming out with swords and staves as against
        a robber to take him (xxvi. 66), <span class="tei tei-q">“All this is
        come to pass that the Scriptures of the prophets might be
        fulfilled;”</span> and Jesus could not pray for legions of angels to
        help him, for (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">v.</span></span> 66), <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“How then could the Scriptures be fulfilled?”</span> The
        conduct of Judas after he had betrayed his master, when he took back
        the pieces of silver, the price of his betrayal, to the priests
        (xxvii. 3 f.), fulfils <span class="tei tei-q">“that which was spoken
        by Jeremiah the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of
        silver, the price of him that was priced, whom certain of the
        children of Israel did price; and they gave them for the potter's
        field, as the Lord appointed me.”</span></p>

        further pursued, however, though the principle applies quite as much
        to the other Gospels. Only one passage may be quoted from the last
        chapter of the third Synoptic. Jesus, when he appears to the
        disciples, after the episode of the fish to prove that he is not a
        spirit, but himself with flesh and bones (xxiv. 36 f.), is
        represented as saying:</p>

        <div class="block tei tei-quote" style=

        <span style="font-size: 90%">These are my words which I spake unto
        you, while I was yet with you, how that all things must needs be
        fulfilled, which are written in the law of Moses, and the prophets,
        and the psalms, concerning me. Then opened he their mind, that they
        might understand the Scriptures; and he said unto them, Thus it is
        written that the Christ should suffer, and rise again from the dead
        the third day: and that repentance and remission of sins should be
        preached in his name unto all the nations.</span>
        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is a direct
        justification of the gnosis, and it is no wonder that we find St.
        Sylvia, some centuries later, recording the concrete principle upon
        which Gospel history is written: <span class="tei tei-q">“Nothing
        took place which had not been previously foretold, and nothing had
        been foretold which had not obtained its fulfilment.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In so far as the
        Gospel according to Peter is concerned, the impartial verdict must
        be: It is neither better nor worse than the more fortunate works
        which have found a safe resting-place within the Canon of the Church.
        It is almost impossible now to judge of these works as we judge the
        fragment. Centuries of reverence, and individual habit <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page133">[pg 133]</span><a name="Pg133" id="Pg133"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of hearing their contents with docility
        and with bated criticism, have rendered most of us incapable of
        judging the effect which a good part of their contents would make
        upon us if, like the fragment of Akhmîm, they had been freshly
        discovered yesterday. There is no canonical glamour to veil its
        shortcomings, and it must not be forgotten that, in this short
        fragment, we have none of those parts of the Gospel, such as the
        Sermon on the Mount and some of the parables, which contain so much
        noble teaching and render the literature so precious. Then, as we
        have before pointed out, the canonical Gospels, in their greater
        circulation and in the process of reception by the Church, secured a
        gradual revision which might have smoothed away any roughness from
        the Gospel of Peter had it been equally fortunate. The three Synoptic
        Gospels are so closely dependent on each other, or on the same
        sources, as to be practically one work; and although this renders all
        the more remarkable certain indications of selection, some of which
        we have pointed out, it nevertheless limits our acquaintance with
        early belief. It is the merit of the fragment that it presents
        considerable variation in the original sources, and shows us the
        fluidity of the early reports of that which was supposed to take
        place during the period which it embraces. We have in it a primitive
        and less crystallised form of the Christian tradition.</p>

          the English equivalent is thus changed, and conceals the analogy of
          the two passages, the addition of δια, strictly considered, cannot
          so change the meaning of σύρω, but rather should imply a

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">With regard to this addition of Luke,
          we may refer to a very interesting letter of Dr. Abbott's in the
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Spectator</span></span> of October 21, 1893,
          from which we take the liberty of extracting the following passage:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“In Luke (xxiii. 45) the correct reading is
          τοῦ ἡλίου ἐκλειπόντος, of which the natural interpretation is,
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the sun
          being eclipsed</span></em>. Now, as it was well known that an
          eclipse could only happen at <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">new</span></em> moon, and as Passover was at
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">full</span></em> moon, this would involve a
          portentous miracle. The probability is that Luke, who was by no
          means afraid of miracles, meant a miracle here. Not content with
          saying (with the Synoptics) <span class="tei tei-q">‘darkness came
          over all the land,’</span> he adds, in order to show that the
          darkness was miraculous, <span class="tei tei-q">‘the sun
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">being
          eclipsed</span></em>.’</span> But is this eclipse <span class=
          "tei tei-q">‘an invention of a conscious or unconscious
          romancer’</span>? An examination of the parallel passages in Mark
          and Matthew will show that it is not. There we find that Jesus
          uttered a cry to God as abandoning Him. These words caused
          difficulty from the first. The words <span class="tei tei-q">‘my
          God’</span> were rendered by some (<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e.g.</span></span>
          the Gospel of Peter) <span class="tei tei-q">‘my Power;’</span> by
          the fourth Gospel the words were omitted; our oldest manuscripts
          exhibit many variations: ἠλι, ἠλει, ἐλωι; the very bystanders are
          said to have interpreted the words as referring to Elias failing to
          help. Now <span class="tei tei-q">‘<em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Elias failing to
          help</span></em>’</span> might be, in Greek, ἡλείου ἐκλειπόντος, or
          quite as often ἡλίου ἐκλειπόντος, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the sun
          being eclipsed</span></em>. It seems extremely probable, then, that
          Luke is not here <span class="tei tei-q">‘<em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">inventing</span></em>’</span> a miracle, but

              increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that
              can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible
              by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.
              Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important
              to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The

              charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the
              United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it
              takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to
              meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit
              donations in locations where we have not received written
              confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the
              status of compliance for any particular state visit <a href=

              cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
              have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no
              prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors
              in such states who approach us with offers to donate.</p>

              International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot
              make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations
              received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp

              originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of
              electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For
              thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg™
              eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project
              Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
              editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the
              U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
              necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
              edition.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Each eBook
              is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's eBook
              number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
              compressed (zipped), HTML and others.</p>

              "font-style: italic">editions</span></em> of our eBooks replace
              the old file and take over the old filename and etext number.
              The replaced older file is renamed. <em class=
